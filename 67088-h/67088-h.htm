<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The characteristics of a college course demanded
by our American undergraduates is
determined by two things; first, by the character
of the man who is to be educated, and second,
by the kind of world in which the man is
to live and work. Without these two factors
vividly and practically in mind, all plans for
courses of study, recreation, teaching, or
methods of social and religious betterment are
theoretical and uncertain.</p>

<p>After ten years of travel among American
college men, studying educational tendencies in
not less than seven hundred diverse institutions
in various parts of the United States and Canada,
it is my deep conviction that the chief need
of our North American Educational system is
to focus attention upon the individual student
rather than upon his environment, either in
the curriculum or in the college buildings.</p>

<p>A few great teachers in every worthy North
American institution who know and love the
boys, have always been and doubtless will continue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
to be the secret of the power of our
schools and colleges. There are indications
that our present educational system involving
vast endowments will be increasingly directed
to the end of engaging as teachers the greatest
men of the time, men of great heart as well as
of great brain who will live with students,
truly caring for them as well as teaching them.
We shall thus come nearer to solving the problem
of preparing young men for leadership
and useful citizenship.</p>

<p>That this is the sensible and general demand
of graduates is easily discovered by asking any
college alumnus to state the strongest and
most abiding impression left by his college
training. Of one hundred graduates whom I
asked the concrete question, “What do you
consider to be the most valuable thing in your
college course?”&mdash;eighty-six said, substantially:
“Personal contact with a great teacher.”</p>

<p class="fs120">Colleges, in like manner, have their indispensable
office,&mdash;to teach elements. But they can only highly
serve us when they aim not to drill, but to create;
when they gather from far every ray of various
genius to their hospitable halls, and by the concentrated
fires, set the hearts of their youth on flame.
Thought and knowledge are natures in which apparatus
and pretension avail nothing. Gowns and
pecuniary foundations, though of towns of gold,
can never countervail the least sentence or syllable
of wit. Forget this, and our American colleges will
recede in their public importance, whilst they grow
richer every year.</p>

<h3>GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">The American college was recently defined
by one of our public men as a
“place where an extra clever boy may go and
still amount to something.”</p>

<p>This is indeed faint praise both for our institutions
of higher learning and for our undergraduates;
but judging from certain presentations
of student life, we may infer that it
represents a sentiment more or less common
and wide-spread. Our institutions are criticized
for their tendency toward practical and
progressive education; for the views of their
professors; for their success in securing gifts
of wealth, which some people think ought to go
in other directions; and for the lack of seriousness
or the dissipation of the students themselves.
Even with many persons who have not
developed any definite or extreme opinions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
concerning American undergraduate life, the
college is often viewed in the light in which
Matthew Arnold said certain people regarded
Oxford:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>Beautiful city! so venerable, so lovely, so unravaged
by the fierce intellectual life of our century, so serene!
There are our young barbarians, all at play!</p>
</div>


<p>Indeed, to people of the outside world, the
American undergraduate presents an enigma.
He appears to be not exactly a boy, certainly
not a man, an interesting species, a kind of
“Exhibit X,” permitted because he is customary;
as Carlyle might say, a creature “run by
galvanism and possessed by the devil.”</p>

<p>The mystifying part of this lies in the fact
that the college man seems determined to keep
up this illusion of his partial or total depravity.
He reveals no unchastened eagerness to be
thought good. Indeed, he usually “plays up”
his desperate wickedness. He revels in his unmitigated
lawlessness, he basks in the glory of
fooling folks. As Owen Johnson describes
Dink Stover, he seems to possess a “diabolical
imagination.” He chuckles exuberantly as
he reads in the papers of his picturesque public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
appearances: of the janitor’s cow hoisted into
the chapel belfry; of the statue of the sedate
founder of the college painted red on the
campus; of the good townspeople selecting
their gates from a pile of property erected on
the college green; or as in graphic cartoons he
sees himself returning from foot-ball victories,
accompanied by a few hundred other young
hooligans, marching wildly through the streets
and cars to the martial strain,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">There’ll be a hot time in the old town to-night!</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>In other words, the American student is
partly responsible for the attitude of town toward
gown. He endeavors in every possible
way to conceal his real identity. He positively
refuses to be accurately photographed or to reveal
real seriousness about anything. He is
the last person to be held up and examined as
to his interior moral decorations. He would
appear to take no thought for the morrow, but
to be drifting along upon a glorious tide of indolence
or exuberant play. He would make
you believe that to him life is just a great frolic,
a long, huge joke, an unconditioned holiday.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
The wild young heart of him enjoys the shock,
the offense, the startled pang, which his restless
escapades engender in the stunned and unsympathetic
multitude.</p>

<p>This perversity of the American undergraduate
is as fascinating to the student of his real
character as it is baffling to a chance beholder,
for the American collegian is not the most obvious
thing in the world. He is not discovered
by a superficial glance, and surely not by the
sweeping accusations of uninformed theoretical
critics who have never lived on a college
campus, but have gained their information in
second-hand fashion from <i>question-naires</i> or
from newspaper-accounts of the youthful escapades
of students.</p>

<p>We must find out what the undergraduate
really means by his whimsicalities and picturesque
attitudinizing. We must find out
what he is thinking about, what he reads, what
he admires. He seems to live in two distinct
worlds, and his inner life is securely shut off
from his outer life. If we would learn the college
student, we must catch him off guard,
away from the “fellows,” with his intimate
friend, in the chapter-house, or in his own quiet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
room, where he has no reputation for devilment
to live up to. For college life is not
epitomized in a story of athletic records or curriculum
catalogues. The actual student is not
read up in a Baedeker. His spirit is caught
by hints and flashes; it is felt as an inspiration,
a commingled and mystic intimacy of work
and play, not fixed, but passing quickly
through hours unsaddened by the cares and
burdens of the world&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">No fears to beat away&mdash;no strife to heal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The past unsighed for, and the future sure.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>It is with such sympathetic imagination that
the most profitable approach can be made to
the American undergraduate. To see him as
he really is, one needs to follow him into his
laboratory or lecture-room, where he engages
with genuine enthusiasm in those labors
through which he expresses his temperament,
his inmost ideals, his life’s choice. Indeed, to
one who knows that to sympathize is to learn,
the soul windows of this inarticulate, immature,
and intangible personality will sometimes
be flung wide. On some long, vague walk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
at night beneath the stars, when the great deeps
of his life’s loyalties are suddenly broken up,
one will discover the motive of the undergraduate,
and below specious attempts at concealment,
the self-absorbed, graceful, winsome
spirit. Here one is held by the subtle charm of
youth lost in a sense of its own significance,
moving about in a mysterious paradise all his
own, “full of dumb emotion, undefined longing,
and with a deep sense of the romantic possibilities
of life.”</p>

<p>In this portrait one sees the real drift of
American undergraduate life&mdash;the life that engaged
last year in North American institutions
of higher learning 349,566 young men, among
whom were many of America’s choicest sons.
Thousands of American and Canadian fathers
and mothers, some for reasons of culture,
others for social prestige, still others for revenue
only, are ambitious to keep these students
in the college world. Many of these parents,
whose hard-working lives have always spelled
duty, choose each year to beat their way
against rigid economy, penury, and bitter loss,
that their sons may possess what they themselves
never had, a college education. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[9-11]</span>
when we have found, below all his boyish
pranks, dissimulations, and masqueradings,
the true undergraduate, we may also discern
some of the pervasive influences which are to-day
shaping life upon this Western Continent;
for the undergraduate is a true glass to give
back to the nation its own image.</p>


<h3>HIS PASSION FOR REALITY</h3>

<p>Early in this search for the predominant
traits of the college man one is sure to find a
passion for reality. “We stand for him because
he is the real thing,” is the answer which
I received from a student at the University of
Wisconsin when I asked the reason for the
amazing popularity of a certain undergraduate.</p>

<p>The American college man worships at the
shrine of reality. He likes elemental things.
Titles, conventions, ceremonies, creeds&mdash;all
these for him are forms of things merely. To
him</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The rank is but the guinea’s stamp,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The man’s the gowd for a’ that.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The strain of the real, like the red stripe in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the official English cordage, runs through the
student’s entire existence. His sense of
“squareness” is highly developed. To be sure,
in the classroom he often tries to conceal the
weakness of his defenses with extraordinary
genius by “bluffing,” but this attitude is as
much for the sake of art as for dishonesty.
The hypocrite is an unutterable abomination in
his eyes. He would almost prefer outright
criminality to pious affectation. Sham heroics
and mock sublimity are specially odious to him.
The undergraduate is still sufficiently unsophisticated
to believe that things should be
what they seem to be: at least his entire inclination
and desire is to see men and things as
they are.</p>

<p>This passion for reality is revealed in the
student’s love of brevity and directness. He
abhors vagueness and long-windedness. His
speeches do not begin with description of natural
scenery; he plunges at once into his subject.</p>

<p>A story is told at New Haven concerning a
preacher who, shortly before he was to address
the students in the chapel, asked the president
of the university whether the time for his address<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
would be limited. The president replied,
“Oh, no; speak as long as you like, but there is
a tradition here at Yale chapel that no souls
are saved after twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>The preacher who holds his sermon in an
hour’s grip rarely holds students. The college
man is a keen discerner between rhetoric and
ideas. No decisions are more prompt or more
generally correct than his. He knows immediately
what he likes. You catch him or you
lose him quickly; he never dangles on the hook.
The American student is peculiarly inclined to
follow living lines. He is not afraid of life.
While usually he is free from affectation, he
is nevertheless impelled by the urgent enthusiasm
of youth, and demands immediate fulfilment
of his dreams. His life is not “pitched
to some far-off note,” but is based upon the
everlasting now. He inhabits a miniature
world, in which he helps to form a public opinion,
which, though circumscribed, is impartial
and sane. No justice is more equal than that
meted out by undergraduates at those institutions
where a student committee has charge of
discipline and honor-systems. A child of
reality and modernity, he is economical of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
praise, trenchant and often remorseless in his
criticisms and censures, for as yet he has not
learned to be insincere and socially diplomatic.
This penchant for reality emerges in the platform
of a successful college athlete in a New
England institution who, when he was elected
to leadership in one of the college organizations,
called together his men and gave them
two stern rules:</p>

<p>First, stop apologizing! Second, do a lot
of work, and don’t talk much about it!</p>


<h3>HIS NATURALNESS</h3>

<p>The undergraduate’s worship of reality is
also shown in his admiration of naturalness.
The modern student has relegated into the
background the stilted elocutionary and oratorical
contests of forty years ago because those
exercises were unnatural. The chair of elocution
in an American college of to-day is a declining
institution. Last year in one of our
universities of one thousand students the course
in oratory was regularly attended by three.</p>

<p>The instructor in rhetorical exercises in a
college to-day usually sympathizes with the remarks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
of one Professor Washington Value,
the French teacher of dancing at New Haven
when that polite accomplishment was a part of
college education. At one time when he was
unusually ill-treated by his exuberant pupils,
he exclaimed in a frenzy of Gallic fervor:
“Gentlemen, if ze Lord vere to come down
from heaven, and say, ‘Mr. Washington Value,
vill you be dancing mast’ at Yale Collège, or
vill you be étairnally dam’?’ I would say to
Him&mdash;‘’Sieur, eef eet ees all ze sem to you, I
vill be étairnally dam’.’” The weekly lecture
in oratory usually furnishes an excellent chance
for relaxation and horseplay. A college man
said to me recently: “I wouldn’t cut that hour
for anything. It is as good as a circus.”</p>

<p>The student prefers the language of naturalness.
He is keen for scientific and athletic exercises,
in part at least because they are actual
and direct approaches to reality. His college
slang, while often superabundant and absurd,
is for the sake of brevity, directness, and vivid
expression. The perfect Elizabethan phrases
of the accomplished rhetorician are listened to
with enduring respect, but the stumbling and
broken sentences of the college athlete in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
student mass-meeting set a college audience
wild with enthusiasm and applause.</p>

<p>Henry Drummond was perhaps the most
truly popular speaker to students of the last
generation. A chief reason for this popularity
consisted in his perfect naturalness, his absolute
freedom from pose and affectation. I
listened to one of his first addresses in this
country, when he spoke to Harvard students
in Appleton Chapel in 1893. His general
subject was “Evolution.” The hall was
packed with Harvard undergraduates. Collegians
had come also from other New England
institutions to see and to hear the man who
had won the loving homage of the students of
two continents. As he rose to speak, the audience
sat in almost breathless stillness. Men
were wondering what important scientific word
would first fall from the lips of this renowned
Glasgow professor. He stood for a moment
with one hand in his pocket, then leaned upon
the desk, and, with that fine, contagious smile
which so often lighted his face, he looked about
at the windows, and drawled out in his quaint
Scotch, “Isn’t it rather <i>hot</i> here?” The collegians
broke into an applause that lasted for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
minutes, then stopped, began again, and fairly
shook the chapel. It was applause for the
natural man. By the telegraphy of humanness
he had established his kinship with them.
Thereafter he was like one of them; and probably
no man has ever received more complete
loyalty from American undergraduates.</p>


<h3>HIS SENSE OF HUMOR</h3>

<p>Furthermore, the college man’s love of reality
is kept in balance by his humorous tendencies.
His keen humor is part of him. It
rises from him spontaneously on all occasions
in a kind of genial effervescence. He seems
to have an inherent antagonism to dolefulness
and long-facedness. His life is always breaking
into a laugh. He is looking for the breeziness,
the delight, the wild joy of living. Every
phenomenon moves him to a smiling mood.
Recently I rode in a trolley-car with some collegians,
and could not but notice how every
object in the country-side, every vehicle, every
group of men and women, would draw from
them some humorous sally, while the other passengers
looked on in good-natured, sophisticated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
amusement or contempt. The whole
student mood is as light and warm and invigorating
as summer sunshine. He lives in a period
when</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">’tis bliss to be alive.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Rarely does one find revengefulness or sullen
hatred in the American undergraduate.
When a man with these traits is discovered in
college, it is usually a sign that he does not
belong with collegians. His place is elsewhere,
and he is usually shown the way thither by both
professors and students. Heinrich Heine said
he forgave his enemies, but not until they were
dead. The student forgives and usually forgets
the next day. The sense of humor is a
real influence toward this attitude of mind, for
the student blots out his resentment by making
either himself or his antagonist appear ridiculous.</p>

<p>He has acquired the fine art of laughing both
at himself and with himself. A story is told
of a cadet at a military school who committed
some more or less trivial offense which reacted
upon a number of his classmates to the extent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
that, because of it, several cadets were forced
to perform disciplinary sentinel duty. It was
decided that the young offender should be
forthwith taken out on the campus, and ordered
to kiss all the trees, posts, telegraph-poles, and,
in fact, every free object on the parade-ground.
The humorous spectacle presented was sufficient
compensation to sweep quite out of the
hearts of his classmates any possible ill feeling.</p>

<p>The faculty song, the refrain of which is</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Where, oh, where is Professor &mdash;&mdash;?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Way down in the world below,</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>and is indulged in by many undergraduate
students, usually covers all the sins and foibles
of the instructors. One or two rounds of this
song, with the distinguished faculty members
as audience, is often found sufficient to clear
the atmosphere of any unpleasantness existing
between professors and students.</p>

<p>Not long ago, in an institution in the Middle
West, this common tendency to wit and
humor came out when a very precise professor
lectured vigorously against athletics, showing
their deleterious effect upon academic exercises.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
The following day the college paper
gave on the front page, as though quoted from
the professor’s remarks, “Don’t let your studies
interfere with your education.”</p>

<p>The student’s humor is original and pointed.
Not long ago I saw a very dignified youth
solemnly measuring the walks around Boston
Common with a codfish, keeping accurate account
of the number of codfish lengths embraced
in this ancient and honorable inclosure.
His labors were made interesting by a gallery
of collegians, who followed him with explosions
of laughter and appropriate remarks.</p>

<p>Not long ago in a large university, during
an exceedingly long and prosy sermon of the
wearisome type which seems always to be coming
to an end with the next paragraph, the
students exhibited their impatience by leaning
their heads over on their left hands. Just as
it seemed sure that the near-sighted preacher
was about to conclude, he took a long breath
and said, “Let us now turn to the <i>other side</i> of
the character of Saint Paul,” whereupon, suiting
the action to the word, every student in the
chapel shifted his position so as to rest his head
wearily upon the other hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[22-23]</span></p>


<h3>RELIGION AND THE COLLEGE MAN</h3>

<p>I have often been asked by people who only
see the student in such playful and humorous
moods, “Is the American college man really
religious?” The answer must be decidedly in
the affirmative. The college boy&mdash;with the
manner of young men somewhat ashamed of
their emotions&mdash;does not want to talk much
about his religion, but this does not prove that
he does not possess the feeling or the foundation
of religion. In fact, at present there is
a deep current of seriousness and religious
feeling running through the college life of
America. The honored and influential students
in undergraduate circles are taking a
stand for the things most worth while in academic
life.</p>

<p>The undergraduate’s religious life is not
usually of the traditional order; in fact it is
more often unconventional, unceremonious, and
expressed in terms and acts germane to student
environment. College men do not, for example,
crowd into the church prayer-meetings
in the local college town. As some one has
expressed it, “You cannot swing religion into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
college men, prayer-meeting-end-to.” When
the student applies to people such words as
“holy,” “saintly,” or “pious,” he is not intending
to be complimentary. Furthermore, he
does not frequent meetings “in derogation of
strong drink.” His songs, also, are not usually
devotional hymns, and his conversation
would seldom suggest that he was a promoter
of benevolent enterprises.</p>

<p>Yet the undergraduate is truly religious.
Some of the things which seem at first sight
quite out of the realm of the religious are indications
of this tendency quite as much as compulsory
attendance upon chapel exercises.
Dr. Henry van Dyke has said that the college
man’s songs and yells are his prayers. He is
not the first one who has felt this in listening
to Princeton seniors on the steps of Nassau
Hall singing that thrilling hymn of loyalty,
“Old Nassau.”</p>

<p>I have stood for an entire evening with
crowds of students about a piano as they sang
with a depth of feeling more readily felt than
described. As a rule there was little conversing
except a suggestion of a popular song,
a plantation melody, or some stirring hymn.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
One feels at such times, however, that the
thoughts of the men are not as idle as their
actions imply. As one student expressed it in
a college fraternity recently, “When we sing
like that, I always keep up a lot of thinking.”</p>

<p>Moreover, if we consider the college community
from a strictly conventional or religious
point of view, the present-day undergraduates
do not suffer either in comparison with college
men of other days, or with other sections of
modern life. The reports of the last year give
sixty out of every one hundred undergraduates
as members of churches. One in every seven
men in the American colleges last season was
in voluntary attendance upon the Bible classes
in connection with the College Young Men’s
Christian Association.</p>

<p>The religious tendencies of the American undergraduates
are also reflected in their participation
in the modern missionary crusades
both at home and abroad. Twenty-five years
ago the entire gifts of North American institutions
for the support of missions in foreign
lands was less than $10,000. Last year the
students and alumni of Yale University alone
gave $15,000 for the support of the Yale Mission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
in China, while $131,000 represented the
gifts of North American colleges to the mission
cause in other countries. The missionary
interests of students on this continent are furthermore
revealed in the fact that 11,838 men
were studying modern missions in weekly student
mission study classes during the college
season of 1909-10. At Washington and Lee
University there were more college men studying
missions in 1910 than were doing so in the
whole United States and Canada sixteen years
ago.</p>

<p>During the last ten years 4338 college graduates
have gone to foreign lands from North
America to give their lives in unselfish service
to people less fortunate than themselves. Six
hundred of these sailed in 1910 to fill positions
in foreign mission ports in the Levant, India,
China, Japan, Korea, Africa, Australia, and
South America.</p>


<h3>THE BACCHIC ELEMENT</h3>

<p>Furthermore, the standards of morals and
conduct among the American undergraduates
are perceptibly higher than they were fifty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
years ago. There is a very real tendency in
the line of doing away with such celebrations
as have been connected with drinking and immoralities.
To be sure, one will always find
students who are often worse for their bacchic
associations, and one must always keep in mind
that the college is on earth and not in heaven;
but a comparison of student customs to-day
with those of fifty years ago gives cause for
encouragement. Even in the early part of the
nineteenth century we find conditions that did
not reflect high honor upon the sobriety of students;
for example, in the year 1814 we find
Washington Irving and James K. Paulding
depicting the usual sights about college inns
in the poem entitled “The Lay of the Scottish
Fiddle.” The following is an extract:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Around the table’s verge was spread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full many a wine-bewildered head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of student learn’d, from Nassau Hall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, broken from scholastic thrall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had set him down to drink outright</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through all the livelong merry night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sing as loud as he could bawl;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such is the custom of Nassau Hall.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No Latin now or heathen Greek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The senior’s double tongue can speak.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Juniors from famed Pierian fount</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had drank so deep they scarce could count</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The candles on the reeling table.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While emulous freshmen, hardly able</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To drink, their stomachs were so full,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hiccuped, and took another pull,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Right glad to see their merry host,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who never wine or wassail crost;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They willed him join the merry throng</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And grace their revels with a song.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>There has probably never been a time in our
colleges when such scenes were less popular
than they are to-day. Indeed, it is doubtful
whether the American college man was ever
more seriously interested in the moral, social,
and religious uplift of his times. One of his
cardinal ambitions is really to serve his generation
worthily both in private and in public. In
fact, we are inclined to believe that serviceableness
is to-day the watchword of American college
religion. This religion is not turned so
much toward the individual as in former days.
It is more socialized ethics. The undergraduate
is keenly sensitive to the calls of modern
society. Any one who is skeptical on this point
may well examine the biographies in social, political,
and religious contemporaneous history.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
In a recent editorial in one of our weeklies it
was humorously stated that “Whenever you see
an enthusiastic person running nowadays to
commit arson in the temple of privilege, trace
it back, and ten to one you will come against a
college.” President Taft and a majority of
the members of his Cabinet are college-trained
men. The reform movements, social, political,
economic, and religious, not only in the West,
but also in the Levant, India, and the Far
East, are being led very largely by college
graduates, who are not merely reactionaries in
these national enterprises, but are in a very
true sense “trumpets that sing to battle” in a
time of constructive transformation and progress.</p>


<h3>THE PLAY LIFE OF THE AMERICAN UNDERGRADUATE</h3>

<p>Undoubtedly one of the reasons which helps
to account for the lack of knowledge on the
part of outsiders concerning the revival in college
seriousness is found in the fact that the
play life of American undergraduates has become
a prominent factor in our educational institutions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Indeed, there is a general impression
among certain college teachers and among
outside spectators of college life that students
have lost their heads in their devotion to intercollegiate
athletics. And it is not strange that
such opinions should exist.</p>

<p>A dignified father visits his son at college.
He is introduced to “the fellows in the house,”
and at once is appalled by the awestruck way
with which his boy narrates, in such technical
terms as still further stagger the fond parent,
the miraculous methods and devices practised
by a crack short-distance runner or a base-ball
star or the famous tackle of the year. When
in an impressive silence the father is allowed
the unspeakable honor of being introduced to
the captain of the foot-ball team, the autocrat
of the undergraduate world, the real object
of college education becomes increasingly a
tangle in the father’s mind. As a plain business
man with droll humor expressed his feelings
recently, after escaping from a dozen or
more collegians who had been talking athletics
to him, “I felt like a merchant marine without
ammunition, being fired into by a pirate ship
until I should surrender.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>Whatever the undergraduate may be, it is
certain that to-day he is no “absent-minded,
spectacled, slatternly, owlish don.” His interest
in the present-day world, and especially the
athletic world, is acute and general. Whether
he lives on the “Gold Coast” at Harvard or in
a college boarding-house in Montana, in his
athletic loyalties he belongs to the same fraternity.
To the average undergraduates, athletics
seem often to have the sanctity of an institution.
Artemus Ward said concerning the
Civil War that he would willingly sacrifice all
his wife’s relatives for the sake of the cause.
Some such feeling seems to dominate the American
collegian.</p>


<h3>CONCERNING ATHLETICS</h3>

<p>Because of such athletic tendencies, the college
student has been the recipient of the disapprobation
of a certain type of onlookers in
general, and of many college faculties in particular.</p>

<p>President Lowell of Harvard, in advocating
competitive scholarship, in a Phi Beta Kappa
address at Columbia University, said, “By free<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
use of competition, athletics has beaten scholarship
out of sight in the estimation of the community
at large, and in the regard of the student
bodies.” Woodrow Wilson pays his respects
to student athleticism by sententiously
remarking, “So far as colleges go, the side-shows
have swallowed up the circus, and we in
the main tent do not know what is going on.”</p>

<p>Professor Edwin E. Slosson, who spent
somewhat over a year traveling among fourteen
of the large universities, utters a jeremiad
on college athletics. He found “that athletic
contests do not promote friendly feeling and
mutual respect between the colleges, but quite
the contrary; that they attract an undesirable
set of students; that they lower the standard of
honor and honesty; that they corrupt faculties
and officials; that they cultivate the mob mind;
that they divert the attention of the students
from their proper work; and pervert the ends
of education.” And all these cumulative calamities
arrive, according to Professor Slosson,
because of the grand stand, because people are
<i>watching</i> foot-ball games and competitive athletics.
The professor would have no objection
to a few athletes playing foot-ball on the desert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
of Idaho or in the fastnesses of the Maine
woods, provided no one was looking. “If
there is nobody watching, they will not hurt
themselves much and others not at all,” he concedes.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile, regardless of their doom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The little victims play.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>In fact, such argument appeals to the average
collegian with about the same degree of weight
as the remark of the Irishman who was chased
by a mad bull. The Irishman ran until out of
breath, with the bull directly behind him; then
a sudden thought struck him, and he said to
himself: “What a fool I am! I am running
the same way this bull is running. I would be
all right if I were only running the other way.”</p>

<p>It will doubtless be conceded by fair-minded
persons generally that in many institutions of
North America athletics are being over-emphasized,
even as in some institutions practical and
scientific education is emphasized at the expense
of liberal training. It is difficult, however,
to generalize concerning either of these
subjects. Opinion and judgment vary almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
as widely as does the point of view from which
persons note college conditions. A keen professor
of one of the universities where athletics
too largely usurped the time and attention
of students, justifiably summed up the
situation by saying:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>The man who is trying to acquire intellectual experience
is regarded as abnormal (a “greasy grind”
is the elegant phrase, symptomatic at once of student
vulgarity, ignorance, and stupidity), and intellectual
eminence falls under suspicion as “bad form.” The
student body is too much obsessed of the “campus-celebrity”
type,&mdash;a decent-enough fellow, as a rule, but,
equally as a rule, a veritable Goth. That any group
claiming the title <i>students</i> should thus minimize intellectual
superiority indicates an extraordinary condition
of topsyturvydom.</p>
</div>


<p>During the last twelve months, however, I
have talked with several hundred persons, including
college presidents, professors, alumni,
and fathers and mothers in twenty-five States
and provinces of North America in relation to
this question. While occasionally a college
professor as well as parent or a friend of a particular
student has waxed eloquent in dispraise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[35-37]</span>
of athletics, by far the larger majority of these
representative witnesses have said that in their
particular region athletic exercises among students
were not over-emphasized.</p>


<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_036" style="max-width: 26.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">University Hall, University of Michigan</p></div>
</div>


<p>Yet it is evident that college athletics in
America to-day are too generally limited to a
few students who <i>perform</i> for the benefit of
the rest. It is also apparent that certain
riotous and bacchanalian exercises which attend
base-ball and foot-ball victories have been very
discouraging features to those who are interested
in student morality. In another chapter
I shall treat at some length of these and other
influences which are directly inimical to the
making of such leadership as the nation has a
right to demand of our educated men. In this
connection, however, I wish to throw some
light upon the student side of the athletic
problem, a point of view too often overlooked
by writers upon this subject.</p>

<p>In the first place, it needs to be appreciated
that student athletics in some form or other
have absorbed a considerable amount of attention
of collegians in American institutions for
over half a century. Fifty years ago, even, we
find foot-ball a fast and furious conflict between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
classes. If we can judge by ancient
records, these conflicts were often quite as
bloody in those days as at present. An old
graduate said recently that, compared with the
titanic struggles of his day, modern foot-ball
is only a wretched sort of parlor pastime. In
those days the faculty took a hand in the battle,
and a historical account of a New England
college depicts in immortal verse the story of
the way in which a divinity professor charged
physically into the bloody savagery of the
foot-ball struggle of the class of ’58.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor ’58 had scarce got well</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">From that sad punching in the bel&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of old Prof. Olmstead’s umberell.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>It will be impossible to fully represent
the values of athletics as a deterrent to the dissolute
wanderings and immoralities common in
former times. Neither can one dwell upon the
real apotheosis of good health and robust
strength that regular physical training has
brought to the youth of the country through
the advent of college gymnasiums and indoor
and outdoor athletic exercises. Much also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
might be said in favor of athletics, especially
foot-ball, because of the fact that such exercises
emphasize discipline, which, outside of
West Point and Annapolis, is lamentably lacking
in this country both in the school and in the
family. While there is much need to engage
a larger number of students in general athletic
exercises, it is nevertheless true that even
though a few boys play at foot-ball or base-ball,
all of the students who look on imbibe the
idea that it is only the man who trains hard who
succeeds.</p>

<p>There is, too, a feeling among those who
know intimately the real values of college play
life, when wholesale denunciations are made of
undergraduate athletics, that it is possible for
one outside of college walls or even for one of
the faculty to produce all the facts with accuracy,
and yet to fail in catching the life of the
undergraduate at play. Inextricably associated
with college athletics is a composite and
intangible thing known as “college spirit.” It
is something which defies analysis and exposition,
which, when taken apart and classified, is
not; yet it makes distinctive the life and atmosphere
of every great seat of learning, and is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
closely linked not only with classrooms, but also
with such events as occur on the great athletic
grand stands, upon fields of physical contest
in the sight of the college colors, where episodes
and aims are mighty, and about which historical
loyalties cling much as the old soldier’s memories
are entwined with the flag he has cheered
and followed. While we are quoting from Phi
Beta Kappa orators, let us quote from another,
a contemporary of Longfellow, Horace Bushnell,
whom Henry M. Alden has called, next
to Emerson, the most original American
thinker of his day. In his oration before the
Phi Beta Kappa Society of Harvard sixty
years ago, Dr. Bushnell said that all work was
for an end, while play was an end in itself; that
play was the highest exercise and chief end of
man.</p>

<p>It is this exercise of play which somehow gets
down into the very blood of the American undergraduate
and becomes a permanently valuable
influence in the making of the man and
the citizen. It is difficult exactly to define the
spirit of this play life, but one who has really
entered into American college athletic events
will understand it&mdash;the spirit of college tradition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
in songs and cheers sweeping across the
vast, brilliant throng of vivacious and spell-bound
youth; the vision of that fluttering scene
of color and gaiety in the June or October sunshine;
the temporary freedom of a thousand exuberant
undergraduates; pretty girls vying
with their escorts in loyalty to the colors they
wear; the old “grad,” forgetting himself in the
spirit of the game, springing from his seat and
throwing his hat in the air in the ebullition of
returning youth; the mercurial crowd as it demands
fair play; the sudden inarticulate silences;
the spontaneous outbursts; the disapprobation
at mean or abject tricks,&mdash;or that
unforgettable sensation that comes as one sees
the vast zigzagging lines of hundreds of students,
with hands holding one another’s shoulders
in the wild serpentine dance, finally throwing
their caps over the goal in a great sweep of
victory. One joins unconsciously with these
happy spirits in this grotesque hilarity as they
march about the stadium with their original
and laughable pranks, in a blissful forgetfulness,
for the moment at least, that there is any
such thing in existence as cuneiform inscriptions
and the mysteries of spherical trigonometry.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Is there any son of an American college
who has really entered into such life as
this who does not look back lingeringly to his
undergraduate days, grateful not only for the
instruction and the teachers he knew, but also
for those childish outbursts of pride and idealism
when the deepest, poignant loyalties caught
up his spirit in unforgettable scenes:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>Ah! happy days! Once more who would not be a boy?</p>
</div>


<p>A friend of mine had a son who had been
planning for a long time to go to Yale.
Shortly before he was to enter college he went
with his father to see a foot-ball game between
Yale and Princeton. On this particular occasion
Yale vanquished the orange and black
in a decisive victory. After the game the Yale
men were marching off with their mighty
shouts of triumph. The Princeton students
collected in the middle of the foot-ball-field,
and before singing “Old Nassau,” they cheered
with even greater vigor than they had cheered
at any time during the game, and this time not
for Princeton, but for Yale. The sons of Eli
came back from their celebration and stopped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[43-45]</span>
to listen and to applaud. As the mighty tiger
yell was going up from hundreds of Princetonian
throats, and as the Princeton men followed
their cheers by singing the Yale
“Boolah,” the young man who stood by his
father, looked on in silence, indeed, with inexpressible
admiration. Suddenly he turned to
his father and said: “Father, I have changed
my mind. I want to go to Princeton.”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">The Serpentine Dance after a Foot-ball Game</p></div>
</div>


<p>Such events are associated (in the minds of
undergraduates) not only with the physical,
but with the spiritual, with the ideal. The
struggle on the athletic-field has meaning not
simply to a few men who take part, but to
every student on the side-lines, while the pulsating
hundreds who sing and cheer their team
to victory think only of the real effort of
their college to produce successful achievement.</p>

<p>Standing beneath a tree near Soldiers’ Field
at Cambridge, with undergraduates by the hundred
eager in their athletic sports on one side,
and the ancient roofs of Harvard on the other,
there is a simple marble shaft which bears the
names of the men whom the field commemorates,
while below these names are written Emerson’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
words, chosen for this purpose by
Lowell:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Though love repine and reason chafe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">There came a voice without reply&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis man’s perdition to be safe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">When for the truth he ought to die.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Not only upon the shields of our American
universities do we find “veritas”; in spirit at
least it is also clearly written across the face
of the entire college life of our times. Gentlemanliness,
open-mindedness, originality, honor,
patriotism, truth&mdash;these are increasingly found
in both the serious pursuits and the play life
of our American undergraduates. The department
in which these ideals are sought is
not so important as the certainty that the student
is forming such ideals of thoroughness
and perfection. This search for truth and reality
may bring to our undergraduates unrest
or doubt or arduous toil. They may search
for their answer in the lecture-room, on the
parade-ground, in the hurlyburly of college
comradeships, in the competitive life of college
contests, or even in the hard, self-effacing labors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
of the student who works his way through
college. While, indeed, it may seem to many
that the highest wisdom and the finest culture
still linger, one must believe that the main
tendencies in the life of American undergraduates
are toward the discovery of and devotion
to the highest truth&mdash;the truth of nature and
the truth of God.</p>

<h3>EDUCATION À LA CARTE</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">“If I were to return to college, I should take
nothing that was practical,” remarked a recent
college graduate. This attitude reveals
by contrast a somewhat wide-spread tendency
of opinion toward practical and progressive
studies.</p>

<p>At a public gathering not long since, the
president of a great State institution in the
Middle West said that he believed within another
decade every course in the institution of
which he was the head would be intended simply
to fit men to earn a livelihood. A cultivated
disciple of quiet and delightful studies
who overheard this remark was heard to say
almost in a groan, “If I thought that was true
of American education generally, I should
want to die.”</p>

<p>An even more significant note of warning
against merely bread-and-butter studies comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
from Amherst College, where the class of 1885
recently presented to the governing board the
radical plan of abolishing entirely the degree
of bachelor of science, with the purpose of
building up a strictly classical course for a
limited number of students admitted to college
only by competitive examinations. The plan
provides for the raising of a fund to meet any
deficiency caused by the temporary loss of students
and also for the increase of teachers’ salaries.
The general idea in the mind of the Amherst
committee is expressed as follows:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>The proposition for which Amherst stands is that
preparation for some particular part of life does not
make better citizens than “preparation for the whole
of it”; that because a man can “function in society”
as a craftsman in some trade or technical work, he is
not thereby made a better leader; that we have already
too much of that statesmanship marked by ability “to
further some dominant social interest,” and too little
of that which is “aware of a world moralized by principle,
steadied and cleared of many an evil thing by
true and catholic reflection and just feeling, a world
not of interest, but of ideas.” Amherst upholds the
proposition that for statesmen, leaders of public
thought, for literature, indeed for all work which demands
culture and breadth of view, nothing can take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[53-55]</span>
the place of the classical education; that the duty of
institutions of higher education is not wholly performed
when the youth of the country are passed from the
high schools to the universities to be “vocationalized,”
but that there is a most important work to be performed
by an institution which stands outside this
straight line to pecuniary reward; that there is room
for at least one great classical college, and we believe
for many such.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Johnston Gate from the Yard, Harvard University</p></div>
</div>


<p>These opinions are impressive. No one can
visit widely our American colleges without
feeling the appropriateness of such warnings
and demands. A story is told of the president
of a college praying in chapel for the prosperity
of his school and all new and “inferior” institutions.
The prayer would seem to have
been answered in the last decade, which marks
the marvelous growth of modern technical institutions
in America. This growth has been
specially pronounced in the great State universities
and in the institutions fitted to train
men in practical education.</p>


<h3>GROWTH OF PRACTICAL EDUCATION</h3>

<p>Dr. William R. Harper is quoted as saying
shortly before his death that “no matter how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
liberally the private institution might be endowed,
the heritage of the future, at least in
the West, is to be the State university.” An
ex-president of a State university has given the
following indication of ten years of advance
in attendance of students at fifteen State universities
in comparison with attendance at fifteen
representative Eastern colleges and universities:</p>

<p>Almost any one of our great universities at
present has many times the wealth, equipment,
and students of all of our colleges fifty years
ago. Our American agricultural and mechanical
colleges, the greater number of which
have arisen within ten years, now enroll more
than 25,000 students. In 1850 there were only
eight non-professional graduate students in
the United States. In 1876, when Johns
Hopkins opened, there were 400 such students.
There are now at least 10,000 students of this
class, and every year finds an additional number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
of our larger institutions including graduate
courses preparing for practical vocations,
with many of them adding facilities for graduate
study during the summer.</p>

<p>The following more concrete comparison by
Professor E. E. Slosson reveals the manner in
which the new State institutions are rapidly
meeting the demands of modern times for technical
and professional education; for the chief
progress in these institutions has been not in
the old-fashioned culture studies, but in special
departments, including well-nigh everything
from engineering and dairying to music and
ceramics:</p>

<h3>WHAT IS THE CHIEF END OF AN AMERICAN
COLLEGE?</h3>

<p>This sudden and enormous advance in the
pursuit of technical studies, which have made
the State universities formidable rivals to our
older, privately endowed institutions, has
aroused uncertainty as to the real object of collegiate
training. Modern commercialism,
which has said that you must touch liberal studies,
if at all, in a utilitarian way, has swept in a
mighty current through our American universities.
The undergraduate is feeling increasingly
the pressure of the outside modern world&mdash;the
world not of values, but of dollars. The
sense of strain, of rush, and of anxiety which
generally pervades our business, our public and
our professional life, has pervaded the atmosphere
in which men should be taught first of all
to think and to grow.</p>

<p>The present tendency of students is to feel
that any form of education that does not associate
itself directly with some form of practical
and significant action is artificial, unreal,
and undesirable. Last winter I visited an institution
on the Pacific coast where literary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
studies were considered, among certain classes
of students, as not only unpractical, but almost
unmanly. As a result of such drift in educational
sentiment, the American undergraduate
is in danger of getting prepared for an emergency
rather than for life. He is losing,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">In action’s dizzying eddy whirled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The something that infects the world.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The student leads his life noisily and hurriedly.
He scarcely takes time to see it all plainly without
dust and confusion. There is all about
him a blurred sense of motion and duties. His
culture lies upon him in lumps. He does not
allow it time to impress him. College is a bewildering
episode rather than a place of clear
vision.</p>


<h3>THE NEED OF LEADERS RATHER THAN MONEY-MAKERS</h3>

<p>It is far easier to turn out of our colleges
mechanical experts than it is to create men who
are thoughtful, men who know themselves and
the world. The value of the modern man to
society does not depend upon his ability to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
always the same thing that everybody else is
doing. College men should be fitted to <i>make</i>
public sentiment as well as to follow it. The
educated leader should be in advance of his
period. Independence born of thoughtfulness
and self-control should mark his thought and
decision. The world looks to him for assistance
in vigorously resisting those deteriorating influences
which would commercialize intellect,
coarsen ideas, and dilute true culture. His
hours of insight and vision in the world of art,
ideas, letters, and moral discipline should assist
him to will aright when high vision is
blurred by the duties of the common day. His
clearer conception of highest truth should lead
him to hope when other men despair. Our
colleges should train men who will be “trumpets
that sing to battle” against all complacency,
indifference, and social wrong.</p>

<p>When a student, however, puts his profession
of medicine or engineering before that of
responsible leadership in social, political, moral,
and industrial life, he ceases to be a real factor
in the modern world. We already have a
thousand men who can make money to one man
who can think and make other men think. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
have a thousand followers to one genuine
leader who incorporates in his own mind and
heart a high point of view and the ability to
present it in an attractive way. It is one thing
for an undergraduate to go out from his institution
expert in electrical science; it is quite
another thing for him to so truly discover the
spirit of life itself, as to be able to harmonize
his expert ability with the broader and
deeper life of the age in which he lives.</p>

<p>The present undergraduate often fails lamentably
at this very point. He frequently
reminds one of the remark of an old gentleman
to an old lady whom I saw at a backwoods
railway-station in Oregon watching a small
white dog chasing with great zeal an express-train
which had surged past the station. The
old lady, turning to her companion, said eagerly,
“Do you think he will catch it?” The
old man answered, “I am wondering what he
will do with the blamed thing if he <i>does</i> catch
it.” The college undergraduate likewise is often
uncertain about what he is to do with his
profession beyond making a living with it.
Our colleges, with their technical training,
should give the conviction that a physician in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
community is more than a medical practitioner.
His success as a physician brings with it an
obligation of interest and leadership in all of
the social, civic, and philanthropic movements
of the town or city in which he works. He
should discover in college that he is to be more
than a doctor; that he is to be also a man and a
citizen. In the last analysis, for real success it
is not a question whether a man is a great engineer
or a great electrician or a great surgeon;
it is the question of individual character.</p>

<p>The pressing inquiry, then, for all undergraduate
training is, Are we giving to our boys
the kind of education which will fill their future
life with meaning? A man must live with
himself. He must be a good companion for
himself. A college graduate, whatever his
specialty, should be able to spend an evening
apart from the crowd. The theater, the automobile,
the lobster-palace, were never intended
to be the chief end of collegiate education. A
college course should give the undergraduate
tastes, temperament, and habits of reading.
A graduate who studies to be a specialist in
any line needs also the education which will
give him depth, background, and the historical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
significance of civilization and life in general.</p>

<p>A lady at a dinner-party was making desperate
attempts to interest in her conversation
a certain business man who had been introduced
to her as a graduate of a prominent university.
She talked to him of books, education,
theater, races, pictures, society, and out-of-door
life. All of her efforts were futile.
Finally he said, “Try me on leather; that’s my
line.” This college graduate lost something
important in his incompetency for general and
intelligent conversation. His loss was more
tragic, however, as a representative of the so-called
college-educated classes, exponents of
specialistic training, who have become materially
successful, but who are without those personal
resources necessary for their own enjoyment
and profit, and who find themselves utterly
inadequate for guidance or incentive to
their fellowmen.</p>


<h3>ELECTIVE STUDIES</h3>

<p>The system of elective studies which now
widely characterizes the training in our higher
educational institutions has made it increasingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
difficult for the college man to secure a clear
idea of a college course and the comprehensive
training which is his due. In many institutions
the whole curriculum is in a state of unstable
equilibrium. The endeavor to follow
the demands of the times and the desire to secure
patrons and students, have often brought
to both the faculty and the undergraduate an
uncertainty as to the true meaning of the college.
Even in freshman and sophomore years
the arrangement of studies is often left to the
choice of the immature student. In one of
our oldest universities there is at present only
one prescribed course of study. For the rest,
the students are allowed to choose at their own
sweet will, and their choice, while dictated by a
variety of motives, is influenced in no small degree
by the preponderance of emphasis, both
in buildings and faculty, upon technical education.
Students are left to flounder about in
their selection of courses, guided neither by curriculum
nor life purpose. Recently I asked
twenty-six students why they chose their studies.
Sixteen of them gave monetary or practical
reasons; six answered that the studies
chosen furnished the line of least resistance as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
far as preparation was concerned; and only
four had in mind comprehensive culture and
preparation for life.</p>

<p>I sympathize with the educator who said recently:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>Is it not time that we stop asking indulgence for
learning and proclaim its sovereignty? Is it not time
that we remind the college men of this country that
they have no right to any distinctive place in any community
unless they can show it by intellectual achievement?
that if a university is a place for distinction at
all, it must be distinguished by conquest of mind?</p>
</div>


<p>While these tendencies threaten, instead of
criticizing too severely our universities and our
undergraduates, we should strive first to find
the reason for these modern scientific and
practical lines of work; and second, to suggest,
if possible, definite ways by which a truer harmony
in educational studies may be brought
about.</p>


<h3>EDUCATION TO MEET POPULAR DEMANDS</h3>

<p>The rapid extension of natural-physical science
in the last fifty years has had much to do
with the change of accent in American education.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
This change of emphasis has effected a
distinct transformation in the curriculum, in
the college teacher and in the student ideal.</p>

<p>Should one care to get one’s fingers dusty
with ancient documents, one might turn to an
old leaflet in the files of the library at Columbia,
dated November 2, 1853. It is the report
of the trustees of Columbia College upon the
establishment of a university system. Among
other things this report outlines, in accordance
with the ideas of the trustees, “the mission of
the college.”</p>


<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_067" style="max-width: 26.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_067.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">The Library, Columbia University</p></div>
</div>


<p>This mission is, “to direct and superintend
the mental and moral culture. The design of
a college is to make perfect the human intellect
in all its parts and functions; by means of a
thorough training of all the intellectual faculties,
to obtain their full development; and by
the proper guidance of the moral functions, to
direct them to a proper exertion. To form the
mind, in short, is the high design of education
as sought in a College Course.” The report
hereupon proceeds to note that unfortunately
this sentiment, “manifest and just” though it
be, “does not meet with universal sympathy or
acquiescence.” On the contrary, the demand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[67-69]</span>
for what is termed progressive knowledge
... and for fuller instruction in what are
called the useful and practical sciences, is at
variance with this fundamental idea. The
public generally, unaccustomed to look upon
the mind except in connection with the body,
and to regard it as a machine for promoting
the pleasures, the conveniences, or the comforts
of the latter, will not be satisfied with a system
of education in which they are unable to perceive
the direct connection between the knowledge
imparted and the bodily advantages to be
gained. The committee therefore “think that
while they would retain the system having in
view the most perfect intellectual training,
they might devise parallel courses, having this
design at the foundation, but still adapted to
meet the popular demand.”</p>

<p>We have here one of the early indications
of “parallel courses” in one of our institutions
of higher learning as a concession to popular
demands. But this concession at Columbia
was made before the immense extension and
development of modern natural, physical, and
industrial science. Education or culture in the
early fifties was something easy to define. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
included logic, literature, oratory, conic sections,
and religion. Since that date, however,
the American undergraduate has discovered
modern research work at the German university.
Cecil Rhodes has opened Oxford for
American students with his “golden key.”
The American student has been called upon to
match with his technical ability the enormous
and rapid development of a new material civilization,
and educational institutions take color
from the social and political media in which
they exist. In fact, it cannot be easily estimated
how real or how comprehensive a factor
the college graduate has been in guiding and
shaping this practical and progressive awakening.</p>

<p>The American undergraduate is more than
ever before contemporaneous with all that is
real and important in modern existence. He
is filled with enthusiasm for civic and social and
religious investigation and improvement.
With self-reliant courage he works his way
through college, tutoring, waiting on table, and
performing other real services. He debates
with zeal economics, immigration, and labor
questions. Indeed, the modern American university<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
is taking increasingly firmer hold upon
the life of the nation. The college graduate
of fifty years ago was more or less a thing
apart. If he was strong in his literary studies,
he was also weak in his attachment to life itself,
where education really has its working
arena. In comparison with him, the student
to-day spends a greater proportion of his time
in the study of political science. One feels the
limitation of the modern undergraduate especially
in the sweep of his literary knowledge,
and in his acquaintance with abstract thought,
art, and poetry. But when we see student and
professor working together on our American
farms, bringing about a new and higher type
of rural life; when we find our mechanical engineers
not only in the mountains and on the
Western prairies, but in the heart of India or
inland China or South Africa, building there
their bridges and railroad tunnels according to
the ideas seen in the vision of their new practical
educational training, we are bound to ask
whether the modern undergraduate is not truly
interested in the deep aim of all true scholarship,
namely, the spiritual and concrete construction
of life by means of ideas made real.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
Ambassador Bryce’s opinion of the American
universities carries weight, and of them he has
said:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>If I may venture to state the impression which the
American universities have made upon me, I will say
that while of all the institutions of the country they
are those of which the American speaks most modestly,
and indeed deprecatingly, they are those which seem
to be at this moment making the swiftest progress,
and to have the brightest promise for the future. They
are supplying exactly those things which European
cities have hitherto found lacking to America; and
they are contributing to her political as well as to her
contemplative life elements of inestimable worth.</p>
</div>


<p>But since undergraduate training must deal
not simply with the theory of education, but
also with the imperative demands and conditions
of a new time, there must be discovered
practical ways by which our undergraduates
may save their literary ideals at the same time
that they enlarge their practical and progressive
knowledge; means by which they may discover
literary, historical, linguistic, and philosophical
values without losing their mathematics
and their physical and material sciences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>To the end, therefore, of making cultural
studies as strong, attractive, and profitable to
our undergraduates as practical and scientific
training, our institutions should train men of
large caliber to teach English and belles-lettres.
They should discover great teachers and
inspiring personalities.</p>


<h3>PERSONALITY OF GREAT TEACHERS</h3>

<p>President Gilman of Johns Hopkins University
took as his motto, “Men before buildings.”
The subject of securing great teachers
for students is perhaps the most vital topic
which can be considered, since from the point
of view of undergraduates a professor, whether
teaching civil engineering or Greek, is invariably
influential because of what he is personally.</p>

<p>In a large university which I recently visited
I was told that there were three thousand students
and five hundred instructors and professors,
an average of a professor to every six
students. Upon asking several of the undergraduates
how many professors they knew personally,
I was somewhat astounded to find that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
less than a dozen of these six hundred teachers
came into personal contact with the students
outside of the classes. One graduate told me
that he had not been in the home of more than
three professors during his college course.</p>

<p>There are undoubtedly reasons for this lack
of association between the professors and the
undergraduates. In a large university, the
demand upon the teacher for more work than
he should rightfully undertake, the ever-increasing
interest of the student in college affairs,
with many other influences, are constantly
presented as difficulties in the way of
the teacher’s close relationship with the student.
But the important point in this association between
student and professor is that in many
cases the professor has nothing vital and individual
to give the undergraduate when he
meets him. In too many cases he is a dry and
weary man, living his life in books rather than
in men. A. C. Benson has described a Cambridge
don in terms that at times we fear fit
some college professors of our own land. He
sits “like a moulting condor in a corner, or
wanders seeking a receptacle for his information.”
The American college teacher has too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
often been chosen simply because of his
scholarship. Our institutions of learning have
been obsessed with the mere value of the degree
of doctor of philosophy. As a consequence,
many a young professor is scholarly
and expert in his knowledge of his subject, but
utterly without ability to impart it with interest.
He lacks driving force as well as guiding
and regulating force. He seems at times
without the capacity for real feeling. He is
not alive to the issues of the time in which he
lives. He starts his subject a century behind
the point of view in which his scholars are interested.
Too often, alas! he misses the chief
opportunity of a college teacher in not becoming
friendly with his undergraduates; for there
is no comradeship like the comradeship of letters,
the comradeship of knowledge, the comradeship
of those whose lives are united in the
higher aims of serious education.</p>

<p>Letters have never lacked their fascination
when they have been embodied in the thought
and personalities of great teachers. Albert
Harkness, with his face aglow with literary enthusiasm,
reading “Prometheus Bound,” in his
lecture-room in the old University Hall at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Providence, is one of the unfading memories
of my undergraduate days. When Tennyson
said, “I am sending my son not to Marlborough,
but to Bradley, the great teacher,” it
was not a <i>subject</i> he had in mind, but a <i>personality</i>.
In one institution which I visit,
virtually the entire undergraduate body elects
botany. A student said to me one day, “We
do not care especially for botany, but we would
elect anything to be under Dr. &mdash;&mdash;.” Not
long ago, attending a college dinner at the University
of Minnesota, I heard a professor at
my side lamenting the tendency to irreverence
on the part of American college men. While
we were speaking, ex-President Northrop
came into the room, and the entire crowd of
students were on their feet in an instant, cheering
their beloved president. One of the undergraduates
closed his remarks by saying that
the deepest impression of his college days had
occurred in the chapel when their honored
president prayed; and he quoted the following
verse:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">When Prexy prays</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our heads all bow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sense of peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Smooths every brow,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our hearts, deep stirred,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No whisper raise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At chapel time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Prexy prays.</div>
</div>
</div>


<h3>THE PROFESSOR IN THE LECTURE-ROOM</h3>

<p>The classroom presentation of the college
professor is also highly important. Many a
subject is spoiled for a student because of the
pedantic, priggish, or solemn manner of the
teacher. Many a teacher is devoted to his subject
and painstaking, but his lack of knowledge
as to the use of incident, epigram, and
enticing speech in presenting his subject, prevents
his popularity and power as a teacher.
Woodrow Wilson says that he had been teaching
for twenty years before he discovered that
the students forgot his facts, but remembered
his stories. We realize that tables of population,
weights, and measures, temperatures,
birth-rates, and dimensions, are at times necessary,
but these should be used in the classroom
with moderation.</p>

<p>Too often a teacher takes for granted that
he has an uninteresting subject, and therefore
gives up the task of making it attractive. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
professor of mathematics, endeavoring to
evade the obligation for good teaching, gave
to a professor of chemistry, whose lecture-room
was always crowded with interested students,
the following reason for the unpopularity
of his subject: “The trouble with mathematics
is that nothing ever happens. If,
when an equation is solved, it would blow up
or give off a bad odor, I should get as many
students as you.” The real reason, however,
was deeper than the nature of his subject. It
lay in the nature of the man. He did not
have the power to bring his subject into vital
contact with reality and with the life of his
students.</p>

<p>The lecture plan also handicaps many a
teacher in this important task of getting near
the student and drawing him out. The seminar
of our larger universities and graduate
schools help much in individualizing the
students. Students may be talked to death.
They themselves often want to talk. An
undergraduate in the South, after hearing
a professor who was without terminal facilities,
told me the old story of Josh Billings, who defined
a bore as a man who talked so much about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
himself that you couldn’t talk about yourself.</p>

<p>In many institutions the students also are
forced to take too many lectures. Their minds
become jaded. Thinking is the last thing they
have power to do in the lecture-room. There
is little desire or opportunity for intellectual
reaction; as one professor of a Western university
humorously remarked:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>They do not listen, however attentive or orderly they
may be. The bell rings, and a troop of tired-looking
boys, followed perhaps by a larger number of meek-eyed
girls, file into the classroom, sit down, remove the
expressions from their faces, open their note-books on
the broad chair-arms, and receive. It is about as inspiring
an audience as a room full of phonographs
holding up their brass trumpets.</p>
</div>


<h3>TWO WAYS OF TEACHING HISTORY</h3>

<p>The most discouraging moments of my college
days occurred during the lecture hours of
history, not because I did not have a natural
bent for history, but because the professor
made the topic, for me, uninteresting. My
mind became a blank almost as soon as I entered
the classroom. Lecture days in history
covered me with a darkness beyond that which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
I had ever imagined could emanate from the
world of fallen spirits. My powers went into
eclipse. There seemed to be a kind of automatic
cut-off between my brains and my note-book.
My only source of comfort consisted
in the fact that my miseries had companionship.
In some examinations, I remember,
only a small remnant of the class succeeded
in satisfying the demands of our scholarly
teacher.</p>

<p>I can only remember flashes and hints of a
long, solemn, student face, shrouded with
whiskers, bending with piercing eye over books
which seemed only slightly less dry than a remainder
biscuit, droning, in “hark-from-the-tombs-a-doleful-sound”
incantation, words,
which to our vagrant attention were just words,
belonging to remote centuries, while about me
my companions shivered audibly, waiting to
be called up. The professor was called a great
student of history. He might have been. We
gladly admitted this: it was the chief compliment
we could pay him. As a teacher and inspirer
of boys, however, he was a good example
of the way to make history impregnable.</p>


<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_081" style="max-width: 26.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_081.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A Popular Professor of Chemistry and his Crowded Lecture-Room</p></div>
</div>


<p>I hold in memory, also, another professor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[81-83]</span>
who taught history. He was seldom called a
professor. The students called him “Benny.”
There was a kind of lingering affection in our
voices as we spoke his name. His lecture-room
was always crowded. No student ever
went to sleep, no student became so frightened
that he lost his wits, no student ever took himself
too seriously. There was an element of
humor and humanness which was constantly
kindled by this great, manly teacher and which
fired at frequent intervals every student heart.
His illustrations were not confined to Horatius
on the bridge, Garibaldi promising his soldiers
disaster and death, or Luther at Worms. He
attached history to modern themes. His historical
situations were described not in the
terms of tedious systems, but in the personalities
of great men. We somehow felt that
he himself was greater than anything he said;
that he himself was a great man. He found
interest in the <i>life</i> of college as well as in the
work of college. He talked about the
last foot-ball game and the reason why the college
was defeated and the lessons that men
should draw from their failure. The value of
his remarks was enhanced by the fact that most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
of the men had seen him on the running-track
in the gymnasium, or on the front
row of the grand stand, cheering patriotically
with both voice and arms. I remember
how he used to add driving power to our awakening
resolves and ambitions. We were quite
likely to forget that we were learning history.
To-day at alumni dinners the mere mention of
the name “Benny” brings an enthusiasm which
the most eloquent speech of any other man
seems incapable of invoking. Here was a man
who also taught history; but the man was more
than his book, he was more than his subject:
he was the light and the blood of it, and the
glory of that theme still brightens the path of
every one of those hundreds of students who
caught a new and radiant vision of the march
of events in the light of a great man’s eyes.
It was of such teachers that Emerson must
have been thinking when he said, “There is no
history, only biography,” and again, “An institution
is but the lengthened shadow of a
man.”</p>

<p>It is of such men that other college graduates
think to-day, even as Matthew Arnold
thought of Jowett at Balliol:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For rigorous masters seized my youth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And purged its faith, and trimmed its fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shew’d me the high, white star of truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">There bade me gaze, and there aspire.</div>
</div>
</div>


<h3>WANTED: THE GREAT TEACHER</h3>

<p>But how are we to train such teachers for
our undergraduates? This is no child’s task.
It is the matchless opportunity of the college;
it is the crying need of our times. A large
proportion of undergraduates in college lecture-rooms
are virtually untouched in either
their feelings or their intellects by the ministry
of the church. Whatever the ministry may
have been in our father’s times, it is not to-day
significant or effective in imparting its message
to students. The fact is periodically
demonstrated by test questions of teachers to
their students concerning the Bible, English
literature, and church history. I have recently
visited a dozen of the leading preparatory
schools whose headmasters and teachers quite
invariably unite in lamenting the inadequacy
of the Sunday-schools and of religious training
in the home. Indeed, many students go
up to our best preparatory schools in almost a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
heathenish condition as regards religion and
Christian knowledge. It is the day and time
of the teacher’s ministry in both secondary
schools and in colleges. No pulpit in our day
is more far-reaching and decisive than the desk
of the college teacher. The college professor
who does not forget that he is first a man, then
a professor, and who can get past the friendship
of books and knowledge to a genuine
friendship with students, can be the highest
force in our present day civilization. But the
teacher says: “I am only a teacher of literature,
or of chemistry, or of engineering, or of bridge-building.
I am not an evangelist or a moral
reformer, or a promoter of polite accomplishments
or of social service.” Much of this is
true also of the great teachers of history. Yet
somehow these men found in their specialty the
door through which they entered into the very
hearts and lives of their school-boys.</p>

<p>A short time ago at the University of Iowa
I had the opportunity of meeting at luncheon
thirty members of the faculty. The subject
for discussion was: “What can the professor
do really to assist students at the University
of Iowa in discovering the values worth while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
in college life?” Approximately one-half of
the teachers for various reasons prayed to be
excused from the discussion. I was specially
interested in the answers of the other men&mdash;among
whom were the men, according to student
testimony, who had a real hold upon the
university life. One man was of the department
of chemistry. He was prominent in student
activities. When he was introduced, a
student said, “There is no man more truly
liked in the university than Professor &mdash;&mdash;.”
As he talked, we felt that, while he might be a
good teacher of chemistry, his department was
chiefly important in giving him a point of departure
from which he could go forth to interest
himself in the life of young men. After
the conference he said to me: “If professors
want influence with students, let them appear
at debates, at athletic games, and at student
mass-meetings; let them show real interest in
undergraduate activities of all sorts, even at
personal sacrifice.”</p>

<p>Another professor was a teacher of English.
He was not interested in athletics or in the religious
life of the students so much as in revealing
to students in the classroom as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
outside the classroom the charm of literary
things. That was his message&mdash;his individual
message to his college. His life-work was
more than presenting the evolution of the English
novel: it was a mission to students to secure
on their part habits of reading and a taste
for genuine literature which in after years
would be to many the most priceless reward of
their college days. It is not necessary that
two college teachers should present the same
truth in the same way, but when college professors
and instructors, presidents, deans, and
tutors, realize that teaching to-day as in former
days is a calling, not simply a means of
livelihood, and that every man who holds any
such position must somehow discover how to
reach personally at least a small circle of students,
then our colleges will not longer be defined
as “knowledge shops,” but as the homes
of those inspirations and friendships, those
ideals and incitements, which make life more
than meat and the body than raiment.</p>

<p>While the drift of our modern life in the outside
world may be toward technical and scientific
education, the drift in college is still toward
the great teacher&mdash;the man of thought-provoking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
power and of spiritual capacity;
sincere and genuine both in scholarship and
manhood, of whom one can speak, as Carlyle
spoke of Schiller, “a high ministering servant
at Truth’s altar, and bore him worthily of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>office he held.”</p>

<h3>THE COLLEGE CAMPUS</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">Rudyard Kipling speaks of four
street corners of four great cities where
a man may stand and see pass everybody of
note in the world. There are likewise vantage-points
in our American colleges from which
one may discover not only the influential undergraduate
types, but also the real life of their
environment. One of these places is the college
campus.</p>

<p>Undergraduate life falls into two broad
divisions: college work, pertaining to the study
and the classroom; and college relaxation,
centering upon the campus. The latter includes
social life, amusements, athletics, and
the other voluntary exercises in which students
meet for fellowship and competition. The
close tie between college work and college play
is often shown. A change in student sentiment
has instant effect on student work, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
no rules of the faculty can nullify those deeply
rooted principles of student life which make
all college men akin.</p>


<h3>A WEST POINT INCIDENT</h3>

<p>This relation of student feeling to college
authority was shown not long ago at West
Point. The cadet corps was under arrest for
having given the “silence” to an officer in the
mess-hall during supper, for reasons deemed
by the cadets to be vital to corps honor and dignity.
The first silence occurred at supper.
The whole corps of cadets, 450 men, were
marched back to barracks supperless, and were
placed under arrest in their rooms. Again at
breakfast the cadets repeated the silence, for
which they were returned to barracks, but not
until they had been made to “double time” up
and down the road for about twenty minutes.
That morning the cadets had virtually no
breakfast. At the next formation for midday
dinner an incident occurred which struck
a chord even deeper than discipline and authority,
and broke the insubordination of the
students. In the autumn one of the cadets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[95-97]</span>
had brought from home a graphophone, and
among the comic-song cylinders was one which
pictured a non-domestic husband about to slip
quietly away from home for an evening at the
club, when his wife confronted him with the
command,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Put on your slippers; you’re in for the night.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>This song was very popular with the cadets.
They were drawn up in front of the barracks,
every man indignant, obstinate, and determined
to repeat the silence, and to continue it
even at the risk of starvation and confinement.
At this critical moment the graphophone, which
had been set to begin its work five minutes
after its humorous owner had left his room, began
to sing in a high-pitched voice through the
open window directly above the lines of cadets,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Put on your slippers; you’re in for the night.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_096" style="max-width: 26.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_096.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Student Waiters in the Dining-Hall of an American College</p></div>
</div>


<p>The effect was irresistible. It was like the
changing of a current in an electric battery.
The eyes of the cadets, despite the fact that
they were at attention, sought the eyes of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
fellows; their faces relaxed, then broke into a
smile. By the time they reached the mess-hall
the whole corps was laughing, and their sense
of humor had swept away the sense of anger
and pride. This was the beginning of the restoration
of the traditional West Point discipline.
The campus had spoken to the classroom.</p>


<h3>“GROWN-UP” COLLEGIANS</h3>

<p>It is through an understanding of this spirit
of the campus that the work of American undergraduates
can be adjusted to modern demands.
The work of the classroom and examination-hall
makes for democracy, while the
social life of the college makes for conservatism
and aristocracy. Campus life is increasingly
difficult to understand because of its growing
complexity. The material needs of our time
have created a class of undergraduates bent on
becoming specialists, and these men have increasingly
less time for either college work or
college life; for them the undergraduate
course is something to be hurried through as a
short cut to professional efficiency. Even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
athletics and college affairs have only a slender
hold upon these utilitarian specialists.
They have a “grown-up” look on their faces as,
eager for scientific research, they rush to and
fro between their rooms and their laboratories.</p>

<p>Undergraduate life is now likewise influenced
by the influx of students who are not the
sons of college men, but who come from homes
the chief ideals of which have been derived from
counting-rooms and laboratories, from brokers’
and railroad offices. These students,
scions of a property-getting class, in conjunction
with the social and the scientific students
in college, help to change the classical traditions.
They emphasize the campus side of college
life more than that of the lecture-room.
Their eyes are upon the stadium rather than
upon the library; the delights of scholarship
influence them less than ambition for leadership
and the importance of “making good” in
student affairs. They are in college for “popular”
reasons, and too often fail to learn how
to think. But they are eager, versatile, adaptable,
with a ready capacity for social adjustment
and modern expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>


<h3>COSMOPOLITAN LIFE AT COLLEGE</h3>

<p>Furthermore, the student world has been
subdivided until it is a wholly different thing
from what it was fifty or even twenty years
ago. While in the seventies the college student
knew every man in his class, in the large
institution to-day an undergraduate will meet
in the college yard scores of classmates who
are perfect strangers, and to whom he has no
more idea of speaking than to persons whom
he has never seen before. The student who
has been brought up always to dine in a dinner-coat
will have for his table-companions
men who have never owned a dress-coat and
who see no immediate prospect of needing
one.</p>

<p>The influx of foreign students has added to
the cosmopolitan life of American institutions.
So far as they are Orientals, the English departments
are specially modified both in the
character of the attendance and the instruction
by their presence. The professor’s task of adjusting
instruction to a mixed assembly of
American, Indian, Mohammedan, Porto Rican,
Chinese, and Japanese students may be inferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
from the answer of a young East Indian
student who was asked to describe in English
his daily routine:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>At the break of day I rises from my own bed, then
I employ myself till 8 o’clock, after which I employ
myself to bathe, then take for my body some sweetmeat,
and just at 9½ I came to school to attend my
class duty, then, at 2½ <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> I return from school and
engage myself to do my further duties then I engage
for a quarter to take my tiffin, then I study till 5 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>,
after which I began to play anything which comes in
my head. After 8½ half pass to eight we are began
to sleep, before sleeping I told a constable just 11 o’
he came and rose us from half pass elevan we began to
read still morning.</p>
</div>


<p>The familiar din of dishes at the commons
of Columbia, as well as at the University of
California, serves to raise the pitch of a polyglot
table-talk that often represents a dozen
nationalities. Last year in American colleges
there were hundreds of undergraduates of
alien speech, customs, ideals, temperaments,
and religion. Among these were a specially
important delegation of three hundred Chinese
young men who were beneficiaries of the Boxer
indemnity fund. These students from foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
nations still further subdivide undergraduate
life through their race clubs, societies
for learning English, special religious
conferences, and new studies.</p>


<h3>COLLEGE TRADITIONS</h3>

<p>College tradition adds its distinctive and
forceful factor to the campus life of the undergraduate,
particularly in the older seats of
learning. A good tradition makes it easy to
accomplish things worth while without the
spasmodic campaigns that characterize many
younger institutions. Students are often more
zealous to uphold the ancient customs of their
college than anything else connected with it.
The annual conflicts between freshmen and
sophomores have become a part of the institution.
Certain traditional habits, often
humorous, sometimes doubtful, in character,
have grown up in nearly every North
American college. An old account of life
at Cambridge tells of the manner in which
both occupant and furniture of a freshman’s
room were menaced by a missile as big as a
cantaloupe that was thrown into it. It was described<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
as a <i>transmittendam</i> (it went with the
room), and was handed down in some such
forcible manner from one generation of freshmen
to another. The desire to link the past
with the present at Harvard is also shown in
the custom of registering the name of each occupant
on the doors of certain old frame buildings
long used as lodging-houses by students.
The old college pump has been a traditional
means of grace to many freshmen, and the customary
restriction to upper classmen of caps,
canes, and pipes has added pugilistic zest to
undergraduate life.</p>

<p>College tradition is not an unmixed blessing
when it results in provincialism and the loss of
that breadth of mind and appreciative sympathy
which should characterize educated men.
When any undergraduate body becomes
blindly a law unto itself, refusing to learn
from other institutions; when faculty and students
take the position that because certain
ideas have never prevailed at their college,
therefore they never should and never shall
prevail, they show their unfitness for leadership
in an age of vast and varied opportunity.</p>

<p>The students of the Middle West and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
Far West are more sensible of their freedom
from the past than are our Eastern undergraduates.
They realize that they are at least
a hundred years behind Eastern colleges in the
dignity of their traditions, and they therefore
seek to crystallize college spirit about college
customs; but their customs do not interfere
with progress, as sometimes happens in the
East, and a question is decided on its merits
quite regardless of precedent or policies. If
a proposition seems sensible and right, it is
adopted, despite its novelty or its conflict with
tradition. Keeping close to modern needs,
those colleges have gone ahead and accomplished
things while more conservative institutions
have been leisurely thinking about them.
It is this audacity of spirit, this dash and action,
which endear to the undergraduates of the
West all men of achievement. When among
them one thinks of the old verse:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, prudence is a right good thing</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And those are useful friends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who never make beginnings</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Until they see the ends,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But now and then give me a man</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And I will make him king,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just to take the consequences,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Just to <i>do</i> the thing.</div>
</div>
</div>


<h3>THE GAIETY OF UNDERGRADUATES</h3>

<p>Traditions are closely connected with college
gaiety, and gaiety forms a real part of
the comprehensive life of the American student.
“Cheerfulness,” says Arnold Bennett,
“is a most precious attainment.” The undergraduate
cultivates it as an art, puts worry behind
him, and faces the world with a laugh.</p>

<p>About his gaiety there is a kind of humorous
bravado. He likes to defy the lightning.
An old graduate of Princeton relates how, in
1857, when the paper called <i>The Rake</i>, because
of its daring criticisms, had brought its
editors under the ban of suspension by the
faculty, the editors injected fun into the dismal
situation by printing the statement, “We
have authority for supposing that even the
faculty do not coöperate as heartily with our
undertaking as they could and should.”</p>

<p>At the University of Michigan a professor,
lecturing on electricity, wished to show that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
fur of a cat is raised by an electrical current.
He asked one day, “Will some student bring a
cat to-morrow, in order that we may show this
experiment?” The next day every one of the
forty students entered the lecture-room with a
cat under his arm!</p>

<p>Mechanical laws seem never to baffle the collegian
in search of gaiety. Indeed, when one
studies some of the mysterious happenings on
and about the college campus, one ceases to
wonder at the mechanical triumphs of the
Egyptians. At one college which I visited,
the stilly night was disturbed by half a hundred
students who, with riotous yells, ran a
two-horse wagon back and forth on an upper
story of a college dormitory, to which place
they had succeeded in hoisting it. This occurred
at midnight, for the delectation of three
hundred students and members of the faculty
who were sleeping below. Next day the college
paper declared that the president of the
institution had been seen at his bedside supplicating
against earthquakes and thunderbolts.</p>

<p>I once visited a small college where the
chapel exercises were abruptly ended because
six or eight barn-yard fowl had been placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
inside the pipe-organ. As several hundred
students marched into the chapel, the old German
professor, who was deaf, began to play
the organ. The commingled sounds that
issued from that instrument when the levers
began to work were described as extraordinary.</p>

<p>Much of the enduring loyalty of college men
clings about the memories of such events. A
college president once said to me that some of
the most important gifts to his institution
came from men who remembered college fun
and “idlesse” long after time had blotted out
the serious impressions of the classroom. As
one apostle of the easy-going side of student
days has said:</p>

<p>“There is some chill and arid knowledge to
be found upon the summits of formal and laborious
science; but it is all around about you,
and for the trouble of looking that you will acquire
the warm and palpitating facts of life.”</p>

<p>Still, there is the duty of drawing a distinct
line between college fun and fundamental decency
and good order. When this line is
crossed, all the authority of the faculty and,
if necessary, the laws of the land should be
brought to bear upon the offenders. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
should be no dallying with undergraduate law-breakers,
no special exemptions for students.
Reprehensible and even criminal acts have been
committed by college men in the last few years
which called for severer punishment than seemingly
they received. It is no kindness to the
undergraduate to overlook acts of dishonesty,
ruthless destruction of property, or dissipated
license. Respect for property and conventions
should be impressed upon a boy before he
reaches college age. It is because lawlessness
has been tolerated by parents in the home, as
well as by over-lenient masters at boarding-school,
that we read continually of offenses
against common sense and respectability, committed
by persons of supposed cultivation.
Few things are more needed in American
life to-day than strengthening the respect for
discipline and lawful authority.</p>


<h3>COLLEGE MEN’S HONOR</h3>

<p>Such abuses of liberty, as well as nearly all
other college delinquencies, can be largely prevented
by a consistent appeal to the undergraduate’s
sense of honor. Recently I asked
the president of a North Carolina college what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
he regarded as the chief characteristic of
American students. He replied promptly,
“College honor.” At Princeton, at the University
of Virginia, at Amherst, and at many
other institutions, the honor system in examinations
arranged and managed by students,
represents the deliberate intention of the undergraduates
to do the square thing. These
laws, which the students voluntarily impose
upon themselves, are enforced more vigorously
than the rules of the faculty.</p>

<p>A few years ago I visited a university at a
time when the entire undergraduate body was
deeply stirred over a matter that involved college
honor. A senior of high standing socially
and intellectually, the son of a prominent
family, high in popular favor, was overheard to
use disrespectful language to his landlady.
The senior was summoned before the student
committee having charge of undergraduate
affairs, confronted with the charges, allowed
to make answer, and, being found guilty,
was asked to leave the institution. His family
and friends, incensed by this demand, which
seemed to them both harsh and unjust, appealed
to the faculty for redress. The chairman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
of the faculty replied that the matter was
entirely in the hands of the students. Application
was then made to the student committee
to present the young man’s side of the question
to the whole college. The student council
readily acceded to this request, saying that
they were perfectly willing to consider the
charges more at length, as their only desire was
to be absolutely just. When he went up for a
new trial the young man’s family engaged a
lawyer. The student body also engaged
counsel. The trial was held in one of the
largest halls in the university town, and virtually
the whole student body sat through
the evening and far into the morning listening
to the presentations of both sides. A judge
who told me of the incident said that during
those hours, looking into those student faces,
he did not remember seeing any man change
his expression, but that every one sat in the attitude
of seeking only the truth. The jury,
which was chosen from the faculty and from
impartial men in the town, found that the
young man had actually used the words attributed
to him, and therefore pronounced him
guilty of the charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>A few months ago an incident occurred at a
Southern college that impressed me deeply.
At one of a series of meetings which I was holding,
a student rose and said that he wished to
make confession to the student body. He
had recently won the sophomore-junior debate,
but wished to confess that he had gained it unfairly.
He had overheard his opponent rehearsing
his debate in an adjoining room, and
although he stopped his ears and refused to
listen, his room-mate took down the points.
Afterward, the debater said, the temptation
was so subtle that he took the notes, arranged
his own debate accordingly, and won. “But,”
he said with deep feeling, “I stole it, and I have
come to plead the forgiveness of the student
body.”</p>

<p>Very early the next morning a young man
called at the house where I was being entertained,
to tell me that he was the room-mate
who had taken the notes mentioned in the confession.
He, too, wished an opportunity to
speak to the students. At the public meeting
that evening, before three hundred college
men, he rose and told of his all-night fight for
character on the college campus. He described<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
the humiliation which he saw confronting
him if he should tell of his part in the dishonorable
proceeding, and said:</p>

<p>“I was helped by a power beyond myself to
make a clean breast of it. I am here to tell
the students that I, rather than the man who
spoke last night, should take the blame for
stealing that debate.”</p>

<p>I do not remember ever having witnessed
such deep feeling, or heard such applause in
any assembly, as greeted that sturdy confession.
It was a triumph of college honor and
integrity, rooted in manhood, conscience, and
religion.</p>

</div>


<h3>SOCIETY LIFE AMONG UNDERGRADUATES</h3>

<p>But the supreme opportunity for the inculcation
and employment of honesty is not reserved
for examinations and public presentations;
it also belongs to the complex social life
of the colleges, which has become important.
The club-book of an Eastern university, for
example, records the existence at that institution
of ninety different social organizations, the
object of most of them being to bring men together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[113-115]</span>
sociably. Such intermingling is vital
for college friendship. It is true, as former
Dean Henry P. Wright of Yale has said, that,
to a student, a friend is a “fellow whom you
know all about, and still like,” and for that
reason the social organizations which bring men
together in an intimacy closer than is found
anywhere else are indispensable aids in the formation
of lasting friendships.</p>

<p>The social groupings of college life are also
important because they give an opportunity
for concrete and tangible success through student
leadership. College society, in fact, has
brought into being a restricted, but very real,
world, with special laws and a kind of
public opinion founded on student initiative
and sentiment. Responsibility and leadership
in college affairs have given many an undergraduate
the initial stir to the qualities which
make him successful in after life. These fraternal
bodies, democratic, discriminatingly
alert for the best men, and usually emphasizing
worth rather than birth, are vital not only
in the discovery of individuality, but also in
their unique contribution to the corporate
strength and unity of college life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>


<h3>COLLEGE FRATERNITY LIFE</h3>

<p>The Greek-letter society is found at the
heart of these undergraduate social activities.
Indeed, fraternities have become in many institutions
as much the center of the college itself
as of college society. So far as social and
moral influences go, the character of the fraternity
which a young man joins is quite as important
as the college or university he selects.
The fraternity students represent the “system”
in college: they choose athletic managers, they
exert the “pull” which controls editorship upon
the college papers, they determine largely the
presidents of classes, and in some cases the elections
to senior societies.</p>

<p>The membership of the thirty-five national
Greek-letter fraternities (not to mention a
hundred or more local fraternities or the fifty
fraternities of the professional schools) now
comprises 200,000 undergraduates and graduates.
These figures do not include the twenty
intercollegiate sororities that claim 250 chapters
and 25,000 members. Three hundred
and seventy colleges and universities at present
contain chapters of national Greek-letter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
fraternities, and millions are invested in the
buildings of these societies. An almanac for
1911 ascribes 1013 fraternity-houses to American
colleges. Half a million dollars is invested
in chapter-houses at the University of Michigan
alone. The property of the eleven fraternities
at Amherst had twenty times greater
money value than Yale’s available funds in
1830; and the property of the fraternities at
Columbia, valued at a million dollars, are as
great as the total productive funds of all the
colleges at the beginning of the last century.</p>

<p>The college fraternity or the college club becomes
responsible for a large and representative
part of the undergraduate life in America.
It is usually responsible for the histrionics in
university life, and there is perhaps no literary
tendency more pronounced in our colleges to-day
than that toward the making of the drama.
Several important plays of recent years may
be traced to graduates who were members of
such clubs as “The Hasty Pudding” of Harvard
and “The Mask and Wig” of Pennsylvania.
At a time when confessedly there is
a crying demand for good, strong plays at the
theater, it is agreeable to hear that the classes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
of professors of dramatic literature are
crowded.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the fraternity is no longer
simply a debating society; it is also a student-home.
There is an increasing tendency, especially
on the part of state institutions, to
make it possible for college fraternities to
erect their buildings on the campus. Every
fraternity-house is the product of much
thought, liberal support, and often sacrifice,
on the part of influential alumni. College authorities
are seriously considering the many
problems connected with these organizations,
for thousands of undergraduates find their
homes in them for four very impressionable
years. The general attitude of the faculties
is wisely not one of repression or of drastic regulation
by rules, but, as President Faunce of
Brown has expressed it, of “sympathetic understanding,
constant consultation, and the endeavor
to enlist fraternities in the best movements
in college life.”</p>

<p>There is, moreover, a plain tendency on the
part of members of college fraternities to face
the dangers as well as to enjoy the advantages
connected with such societies. They realize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
that these organizations can be effectively influenced
only by a leavening process within the
fraternity itself, for external pressure and
rules have never yet succeeded in forming or
changing student sentiment. The fraternity
can establish manliness and decency, or sportiness
and laziness, as its ideals, and these ideals
are clearly reflected in the membership. The
inclination of these bodies to assume definite
responsibility for the moral welfare of their
members is indicated by the action of some of
the old national fraternities, which have chosen
efficient field-secretaries to travel among the
chapters in order to study conditions and to assist
in the direction, control, and general betterment
of fraternity activities. The type of
men selected for membership is being more
carefully scrutinized. In a considerable and
growing number of institutions, students are
not chosen for membership until the end of the
freshman year; there is thus needful opportunity
on both sides for more intelligent choice.</p>

<p>More and more the coöperation of fraternity
alumni is being sought by the authorities.
These graduates, who are often largely responsible
for the fine houses of the fraternities, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
justly called upon by the college to assist in
maintaining proper regulations within them.
Moreover, assurance is given that the fraternity
itself wishes to coöperate with the faculty
in securing a higher grade of scholarship,
which fraternity life too frequently menaces,
and in demanding the reform of conditions
leading to delinquency of all kinds. There is
no police force really effective for a college
community but a student police force, and this
operates not by external pressure, but by internal
persuasion.</p>

<p>A real danger of the modern college fraternity
lies in its distraction from the real work
of the college&mdash;study and the intellectual life&mdash;through
habits of indifference, laziness, or
immorality. The chapter-house tends to suggest
that college work is optional, not imperative.
“Thou shalt not loaf!” as an eleventh
commandment, written across the doorposts
of a fraternity club-house in the Middle West,
is no inappropriate injunction. The undue
and distressing waste of time in inconsequent
and foolish play, the inevitable interruptions,
the dissipations of social events, the inane profligacy,
the autocracy of athletics, the feeble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
conversations that “skim like a swallow over the
surface of reality”&mdash;all these are too often the
doubtful compensations received by the college
man as fraternity privileges.</p>

<p>“The modern world is an exacting one,” says
ex-President Woodrow Wilson, “and the
things that it exacts are mostly intellectual.”
One often wonders, in visiting the fraternities
of America, how large a place this intellectual
work holds in college life. Was that Eastern
college professor justified in saying that some
fraternity men are not unlike the old farmer
down East who was usually to be found in a
comfortable arm-chair in the post-office, and
when asked what he did, replied, “I just set
and think, and set and think, and sometimes I
just <i>set</i>.” The fraternity-house that becomes
a place to “set” rather than a place to work is
hardly a credit to a college campus. As President
Northrop said to some society men at the
University of Minnesota, “If your fraternity
is not a place for intellectual and moral incitements,
it is a failure, and it must go the way of
all failures.”</p>

<p>Among other gifts, the American college
fraternity may justly be expected to bestow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
upon its members devoted friendship, the
ability to live successfully with other men, and
such habits of application, industry and sobriety
as develop ideas and character.</p>


<h3>THE UNDERGRADUATE’S PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE</h3>

<p>But this hint at the somewhat free-and-easy
life of the fraternity chapter-house should not
leave the impression that the American undergraduate
is, as a rule, a thoughtless creature or
that he fails to formulate a philosophy of life.
Gilbert K. Chesterton remarks, “There are
some people, and I am one of them, who think
that the most practical and important thing
about a man is still his view of the universe.”
Certain beholders of collegiate conditions have
evidently become acquainted with only those
students who have thoughtlessly taken their
serious views, in second-hand fashion, from
their ancestors or from current opinion.
These spectators have perhaps justly concluded
that the undergraduate has no view of life&mdash;no
view, at least, which is complimentary to
him.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_123.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">The Main Hall, University of Wisconsin</p></div>
</div>


<p>Such an impression is not general among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[123-125]</span>
those who are familiar with the inner working
of the undergraduate mind and have watched
the result of his philosophy in practical works.
Many of the vital movements of the time have
originated among these seemingly thoughtless
college men. It was in a small room at Princeton,
in the year 1876, that Cleveland H.
Dodge, W. Earl Dodge, and Luther D.
Wishard, after earnest conversation regarding
the moral and religious life of the institution,
decided to send delegates to the next year’s
Convention of the International Committee of
Young Men’s Christian Associations, held in
Louisville, Kentucky. This delegation presented
to the International Committee plans
for the Student Young Men’s Christian Association
at Princeton. Other groups of undergraduates
took similar action both in
America and in other countries, until at present
the World’s Student Christian Federation
includes 148,300 students and professors in its
membership. These federated movements
represent twenty-one nations. In connection
with these societies during the last college season
66,000 students met regularly for Bible
study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>These associations at the colleges have given
rise to many other organizations which have
stimulated the educated life of the world.
The Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign
Missions, which originated in connection with
a student conference at Mount Hermon, Massachusetts,
in the year 1886, has been responsible
for enlisting thousands of collegians who
have been sent by churches and Christian organizations
to serve in foreign lands. This
student missionary organization is also accomplishing
an educational work in familiarizing
undergraduates with the social, political, and
religious conditions of foreign nations. The
college Christian associations now have 163
graduates among their employed officers in the
institutions of higher learning in North America.</p>

<p>Undergraduate philosophy of life is an evolution.
It consists of three stages: the first is
characterized by a sense of calamity or fear as
the student leaves behind the observances and
conventional creeds of childhood, held with unquestioning
and often unthinking assent. He
begins to think for himself. He enters an atmosphere
of thoughtfulness and scientific discovery,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
an environment in which facts come before
opinions. His first alarm is because he
thinks he is losing his religion. He says, like
the prophet Micah, when the hostile Danites
took away his images, “Ye have taken away my
gods ... what have I more?”</p>

<p>In the second period of his thinking he
changes his early ceremonial god for breadth
of mind. He revels in his impartial view
of men and the universe. By turns he
calls himself a pantheist, a pragmatist,
or an agnostic. His religious position is at
times summed up in the description of a young
college curate by a bishop who said the young
man arose in his pulpit with a self-confidence
begotten of fancied wisdom, saying to his expectant
hearers: “Dearly beloved, you must repent&mdash;as
it were; and be converted&mdash;in a measure;
or be damned&mdash;to a certain extent!”</p>

<p>The third stage of the undergraduate’s philosophy
is usually in line with constructive action.
He begins to be interested in doing
something, and practice for him, as for men
generally, helps to solve the riddle of the universe.
The best test of college theology or
college philosophy is its serviceableness, its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
power to attach the student to something which
needs to be done, and which he can do. Many
an undergraduate whose college course has
seemed an intellectually unsettling period has
found himself upon solid ground as soon as he
has begun seriously to engage in the world’s
work.</p>

<p>Indeed a strikingly aggressive social propaganda
is now in operation in the North American
colleges. The college student, like the
modern American, is a practical being and is
interested in securing practical results. His
first question regarding any movement usually
is, “What is it doing that is really worth
while?” Recently a graduate of an Eastern
university was secured to give his entire time
to the study and promotion of social service
in the colleges of the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>An example of such service is demonstrated
by the social work that the University of Pennsylvania
is doing in connection with its settlement
house in Philadelphia, which is owned
and conducted by the Christian Association of
the university. The settlement, erected in the
river-front district, immediately opposite the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
university, at Lombard and Twenty-sixth
streets, consists of a group of buildings built
at a cost of $60,000; a children’s playground
adjoining the house; an athletic field across the
river; and, forty miles from Philadelphia, a
beautifully situated farm of sixty-four acres,
used for a camp for boys and girls, for mothers
and children, in the summer months. Every
year one hundred students and members of the
faculty take part in the active service and support
of the settlement. Among the activities
are the following: Boys’ and girls’ and adults’
clubs; industrial classes; athletics; dispensary;
modified milk station; visiting physician; resident
nurse; public lectures; entertainments;
religious meetings; social investigation; political
work; and the usual activities of a playground,
athletic field, and summer camp.
Former residents and volunteer workers of the
settlement are scattered throughout the world
engaging in social and religious work. Four
are medical missionaries in China, one is a missionary
in Persia, another in Honolulu, another
in South America, while three are holding
prominent positions in social work in this country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>


<h3>PHILOSOPHY OF SERVICEABLENESS</h3>

<p>Such works, with numerous other tendencies
which might be mentioned in the line of unpaid
and voluntary service for college publications,
musical organizations, debating organizations,
and athletics, lead one to define the American
undergraduate’s philosophy of life as one of
service. Unlike the German or Indian, his
seriousness is not associated with metaphysical
or theological discussion or expression. He
asks not so much <i>What?</i> as <i>What for?</i> His
aims belong to “a kingdom of ends.” Student
theory operates in a real world&mdash;a world where
contact is not so marked with creeds and laws
as with virile movements and living men.
The undergraduate is enamoured of a gospel
of action. To him “deeds are mightier things
than words” are. His spirit slumbers under
sermons and lectures upon dogma and description,
but rises with an heroic call to give money,
time, and life for vital college or world enterprises.
Difficulties stir him as they always stir
true men. He admires the power that is
“caught in the cylinder and does not escape in
the whistle.” More and more plainly in all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
his undergraduate and graduate work the
American student is revealing his love and
ability for that serviceableness to the state, to
the church, and to industrial life which, though
often unpaid and unappreciated, brings to the
servant a satisfying reward in the doing.</p>

<p>A few years ago a Harvard athlete played
in a hard and exciting foot-ball game against
Yale. Toward the end of the game, when it
was nearly dark, this man was fairly hurled
through the Yale line in a play that shortly
afterward resulted in giving the game to the
Cambridge men. It seemed a strange irony
of circumstance that just before time was called
the heroic player was disqualified. When the
game was over and the crimson men were
marching wildly about the field, yelling for
Harvard and carrying the foot-ball players on
their shoulders, the man whose playing was
largely contributory to this triumph was down
in the training-quarters, almost alone, but with
the satisfaction that, although forgotten by the
crowd, he had “played the game.” Certain
alumni, who had seen this man’s plucky but
unpraised fight for his Alma Mater, sent to
him these words of Kipling:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And only the Master shall praise us, and only the Master shall blame;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But <i>each for the joy of the working</i>....</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>We must admit that the undergraduate’s
philosophy of life may be obscure at times,
even to himself; that it is as subtle and evasive
as the moods of youth; and that its expression
is as cosmopolitan as nationality, and as varied
as human nature. For some students, too, we
must conclude that trivialities and immoralities
bury far out of sight the true meaning of college
training and life-work; but in other students,
and these are the majority, underneath
his curriculum and his customs, his light-heartedness,
his loves, and his seeming listlessness,
one may discern the real American undergraduate,
energetic, earnest, expectant, and
strenuously eager for those great campaigns
of his day and generation in which the priceless
guerdon is the “joy of the working.”</p>

<h3>REASONS FOR GOING TO COLLEGE</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">Recently I attended the commencement
exercises at one of our large universities.
As undergraduates and friends of
the graduating class were gathered in a large
church awaiting the arrival of the procession,
in a seat directly in front of me sat a middle-aged
woman and a man whose appearance and
nervous expectation drew general attention.
The man’s clothes were homely and of country
cut. His face was deeply lined, and wore
the tan of many summers. I noted his hard,
calloused hand resting on the back of the seat
as he half rose to look at the door through
which the seniors were to enter. The woman
by his side was a quiet, sympathetic person to
whom a phrase from Barrie would be applicable:
she had a “mother’s face.”</p>

<p>While many eyes were turned toward the
old couple, the commencement procession entered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
the church. The two seemed scarcely
to notice the dignitaries who led the procession,
but their eyes were straining to catch the
first glimpse of the seniors. At least half of
the audience were now interested in this father
and mother. The latter suddenly placed both
hands upon the man’s arm. Her face beamed,
and an answering light appeared in the face
of a strong young man who marched near the
head of the seniors. That day some persons
in the audience heard only listlessly the commencement
speeches. Instead, they were picturing
the couple back on an upland farm of
New England, dedicating their lives to the
task of giving their boy the advantages which
they had never received, and which they must
have felt would separate him forever from
their humble life and surroundings. It had
been no easy path up which this pair had
struggled to the attainment of that ambition.
This was the day of their reward. All the
gray days behind were lost in the radiance of
pride and love. The father was full of joy
because he had had the privilege of working
for the boy, while to the mother it was enough
that she had borne him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>Such scenes are still frequent in commencement
time, and they are significant. Does it
really pay to send boys to college in America?
Is the game worth the candle? Is the contemptuous
notice placed by Horace Greeley
in his newspaper office still applicable: “No
college graduates or other horned cattle need
apply”? We can probably take for granted,
as we consider the vast expenditure of money
and time and men in the cause of American
education, that the people of the country are
believing increasingly in the value of college
training; but to many persons there arises the
question, To what college shall we send our
young hopeful? There is even a more basic
question, Why go to college at all?</p>

<p>Rather than theorize on this subject, I
asked one hundred recent graduates of North
American colleges to tell me what decided
their choice of an institution, the chief values
derived from their college course, and the effect
of college training upon their life-work.
The following is a summary of the testimony
thus obtained:</p>

<p>The values of a college course are strikingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
presented by the following answers: A Johns
Hopkins man attributes to his university “a
desire for, search after, and acceptance of the
truth regardless of the consequences.” A recent
alumnus of Boston University says: “I
learned to have a far broader view of what
teaching (my profession) really is. When I
entered college I regarded it as a process of
instilling a knowledge of facts in a young person’s
mind; when I was graduated I knew that
this was a very small part, merely a means to
the great end&mdash;the development of personality.”
A graduate of the University of
Georgia says that his college course meant to
him “a self-unfoldment, a diversity of interests
in life, a growth of ideals, of purposes,
and of judgment; strong convictions and
friendships.” A student from the School of
Mines in Colorado considers the chief value of
his college training was the giving him “a
vision of a life-work instead of a job”; a graduate
of the University of Louisiana writes
that the chief value to him was “a realization
that I was worth as much as the average man”;
while an alumnus of Vanderbilt University
said that his course gave him “the feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
equality and of opportunity to do things and
be something along with other men. It has
meant, perhaps, a greater chance to do my
best.”</p>


<h3>CHOOSING A COLLEGE</h3>

<p>The choice of a college, according to this
testimony, is largely dependent upon one of
three things,&mdash;the location of the institution
(involving expense), the influence of friends
or relatives, and the advantages the institution
may offer for special training. The selection
of the college, however, is not so important
as formerly. Every prosperous institution
now gives sufficient opportunity for
the acquirement of knowledge and training.
Apart from the prestige which the name of a
large and well-known university or college
gives to its graduates in after life, the difference
between the values imparted by scores of
American institutions is not considerable.
There are at least a hundred institutions in
America sufficiently well equipped to give a
boy the foundation of mental training that a
college education is intended to supply.
Their libraries are filled with books; their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[141-143]</span>
laboratories contain expensive and elaborate
modern appliances; their gymnasiums are
preëminent in equipment; their instructors
are drawn from the best scholars in the country
and also from the finishing schools of Europe;
the spirit of athletics and undergraduate
leadership are, as a rule, strongly emphasized,
while the fraternity and social systems afford
rare opportunities for friendship. Temptations
and college evils vary comparatively little
in different institutions.</p>


<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_141" style="max-width: 26.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_141.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Blair Arch, Princeton University</p></div>
</div>


<p>The advantages of contact and the acquirement
of experience through the laboratory of
a big city institution are frequently more than
counterbalanced by the close fellowship and
the lack of distractions in a small country college.
It is true that the investigators of the
Carnegie Foundation found a large variation
in the amount of money expended by different
institutions to educate a student. It is my belief,
after visiting more than five hundred institutions
in North America, that the quality
of instruction in any one of these institutions
of the first grade does not vary sufficiently to
render the choice of a college on the ground of
educational advantages a matter of great moment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
The values which the small college
loses from inferior equipment are usually offset
by the more direct access of the student to
the personality of the teacher, and often by
closer friendships with fellow-students.</p>

<p>Indeed, educational results are not always
commensurate with material advantages. As
President Garfield said, a man like Mark
Hopkins on one end of a bench and a student
on the other end is still the main essential of
a college. Many years ago Henry Clay visited
Princeton, and was asked by President
McLean (Johnnie, as he was familiarly and
popularly called) to sit down in the president’s
study. The furniture was not elaborate
in those days, nor did it consist of the
most solid material. Mr. Clay sat down, and
the rickety old chair which was proffered him
sank beneath his weight. The statesman,
rising from the floor, said solemnly, “Dr. McLean,
I hope that the other chairs of this institution
are on a more permanent foundation.”
Indeed, the foundation of learning in
those days was laid upon the personality of
great teachers who, like Dr. McLean, had personal
contact with the students, making up in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
individual interest what was lacking in material
equipment.</p>

<p>It is important that the student should
choose instructors quite as carefully as institutions.
What a man selects when he gets to
college&mdash;his studies, his teachers, and his
friends&mdash;will prove far more vital to him than
the institution he happens to choose.</p>


<h3>IDEALS JOINED TO ACTION</h3>

<p>Whether in college or out in the world, the
important thing is that college gives an opportunity
not only for the acquirement of
knowledge, but also for the matching of that
knowledge against real problems. Something
definitely good is derived from new adjustments.
Education can never be completed
at home. The college boy returns to
his old home with new reverence, with a new
conception of its meaning. He has secured a
vision that enriches and liberates by getting
in touch with universal interests. He has gotten
out of himself into the life of others.</p>

<p>College brings together ideas and action.
It is the practice-ground for honor and square-dealing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
A championship base-ball game was
played recently between Wesleyan and Williams
at Williamstown. This game was the
last one of a series, and it was to decide which
college should hold the championship for the
coming year. The tension was naturally
great. At the end of the seventh inning the
score stood 1 to 0 in favor of Wesleyan.
The last Williams man at the bat knocked a
slow “grounder” to the short-stop. In throwing
it to first base, he drove it so high that the
first baseman, in attempting to get it, stepped
about an inch off the base. The umpire
called the man out, but the Wesleyan first
baseman, going up to the umpire, said, “That
man was not out.” Williams finally won
that day, but Wesleyan had the satisfaction
of knowing that their man had “played the
game.”</p>


<h3>TRAINING OF THE INDIVIDUAL</h3>

<p>One of the chief functions of the American
college is to discover the man in the student,
and to train him for citizenship and public
service. President Hadley of Yale points
out the fact that of the twenty-six presidents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
of the United States, seventeen were college
men, and of these seventeen, fourteen were
graduates of the old-fashioned classical colleges.
Grant was a West Point man, Monroe
and McKinley left college before the end
of their junior year, one to go to the army, and
one to teach school. This contribution of individual
leadership to a nation seems to be
proper and fitting, as Dr. Hadley says:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>If a college man has used the opportunities offered
by the faculty, he has acquired a wide knowledge of history
and a broad view of public affairs. If he has utilized
the opportunities offered by his fellow-students, he
has acquired the democratic spirit, has gotten a grip
upon public opinion, and has had considerable experience
in dealing with a large variety of men. All these
things give him an advantage in the race, and statistics
show that he makes good use of this advantage.</p>
</div>


<p>This power of the American college to develop
individual initiative and leadership has
been decidedly enhanced in recent years. The
college in the United States has gradually developed
from a quasi-family institution for
growing school-boys to a small world of wide,
voluntary opportunity for young men. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
is a decided difference between American undergraduate
life to-day and that of a century
ago, or even of fifty years ago. Then boys
were graduated at eighteen or nineteen years
of age, and they were under the watchful eye
of presidents, professors, and tutors, who were
<i>in loco parentis</i>. The earlier period was a period
of flogging and fagging and “freshmen
servitude rules.” Indeed, the age was one of
black-and-blue memories derived from those
educational lictors who with their rods made
deeper impressions than all the Roman Cæsars.
Freshmen were forbidden to wear hats in the
president’s or professors’ dooryards or within
ten yards of a president, eight rods of a professor,
or five of a tutor. These young men
were forbidden to run in the college yard or
up or down stairs or to call to any one through
a college window. Seniors had the power to
regulate the dress and the play of underclass
members. In those early days fines and penalties
for misdemeanors ran from half a
penny up to three shillings, while sophomores
had their ears boxed before the assembled college
by the president or a member of the faculty.
The conclusion of the college prayer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
indicated the enforced humility of students in
those days: “May we perform faithfully our
duties to our superiors, our equals, and our
inferiors.”</p>

<p>American college life had its rise in New
England institutions presided over by rigorous
Puritans whose hands were as hard as
their heads, who believed in total depravity
and original sin, and who held the young
sternly to account for any remissness. In
those early days student community life differed
little from student home life; both failed
dismally to develop initiative or individual responsibility.
They were characterized by
strict authority on the part of the parent and
teacher, and ingenious attempts to outwit this
authority on the part of the young. It was
this conception of the college which led the
Massachusetts legislature to give the Harvard
faculty authority to inflict corporal punishment
upon Harvard students. At that time
it was easy for a student to determine his life-work,
for the great majority of boys either
entered the ministry, or studied law or medicine.
The whole college living was simple
and homogeneous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>


<h3>GOVERNMENT BY UNDERGRADUATES</h3>

<p>Existence in the modern American college
is quite another thing. In the college itself
there has arisen an interminable round of
activities which make demands on the talents
and abilities of students. Managerial, civic,
social, religious, athletic, and financial leadership
is exemplified in almost all colleges. Undergraduate
leadership is the most impressive
thing in college life. One reason for the
sway of athletics over students exists in the
fact that through these exercises the student
body recognizes real leadership. Loyalty to
it is repeatedly seen. At a small college the
students may elect their best pitcher as the
president of the senior class; their best jumper
for the secretary; and, regardless of the subtlety
of the humor, may choose their best runner
for the treasurer of the class. The president
of another college has estimated that in
his institution the regular college activities
outside of the curriculum reached a grand total
of twenty-seven, and included everything
from the glee-club leader to the chairman of
an old-clothes committee. The dean of another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
institution who felt this overwhelming
change in student affairs is quoted as recommending
“a lightening of non-academic demands
upon the students.”</p>

<p>A college man is surrounded, therefore,
with ample opportunity for individual development.
His habits and his executive abilities
are considered quite as important as his
“marks” when the final honors are awarded.
In short, the real government of our large
North American institutions is to-day in the
hands of the students, however much the faculty
may think that they wield the scepter.
Honor systems, athletics, college journalism,
fraternity life, self-support, curriculum, seminars,
unrestrained electives, student researches,
and laboratory methods&mdash;all these
are signs of the new day of student individualism.
The parental form of government is
less popular; the self-government idea is now
the slogan in student life. The dogmatic college
president whom I met recently in a Western
State who insisted that in <i>his</i> college there
shall be no fraternities or no athletics is
marching among the belated leaders of modern
education. Meanwhile embryonic statesmen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
and railroad managers are discovering themselves
and their life-work in the society and
politics of undergraduate days. In the ninety
per cent. of his time which it is estimated the
American undergraduate spends outside of his
recitations, there is increasingly the tendency
to make the college a practice-ground for the
development of personal enterprise, individuality,
and efficiency.</p>


<h3>LEARNING TO THINK</h3>

<p>At least twelve college presidents have said
to me during the last year that in their judgment
the chief advantage of a college course
is learning to think. It has been stated by
Dr. Hamilton Wright Mabie that to Americans
no conquests are possible save those
which are won by superiority of ideas. Professor
George H. Palmer tells an anecdote of
a Harvard graduate who came back to Cambridge
and called upon him to express his
gratitude for certain help which had come to
him in Professor Palmer’s classroom, and
which had directly influenced his life. The
professor, naturally elated, hastened to inquire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
what particular remark had so influenced
the young man’s career. The graduate replied:
“You told us one day that John Locke
insisted on <i>clear ideas</i>. These two words
have been transforming elements in my life
and work.”</p>

<p>The colleges liberate every year a tremendous
vital force, which is a prodigious energy.
It may drive men aimlessly into all kinds of
trifling, display, and doubtfully acquired possessions,
or it may be harnessed to clear ideas
and sturdy convictions on the great subjects
of nationalism, industrialism, and enlightenment
through schools and art and literature
and religion. Education in the fullest meaning
of the term is the source and secret of
American success. Some of our colleges are
older than the nation. Harvard was founded
in 1636, William and Mary in 1693, Yale in
1701, Princeton in 1746, all before our distinctively
national life began. The colleges
are the training centers of the nation’s life,
and to the trained men of any nation belong
increasingly the opportunities and the prizes
of public life. Bismarck was sagaciously
prophetic when he said that one-third of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
students of Germany died because of overwork,
one-third were incapacitated for leadership
through dissipation, and the other third
ruled Germany. The future welfare of the
peoples of the earth is in the hands of the men
who are being trained by the schools for service
and public leadership. The power of
leadership is developed in part at least by the
expression of ideas in writing and speaking.
President Eliot is quoted as saying that the
superior effectiveness of some men lies not in
their larger stock of ideas, but in their greater
power of expression. Many a student has
learned to give expression to his ideas and convictions,
and many an editor has found his vocation,
by writing for the college journals.</p>

</div>


<h3>COLLEGE JOURNALISM</h3>

<p>But the condition of college journalism at
present does not confer high honor on the
American undergraduate or on American colleges.
When we look beyond the college
daily, we find literary periodicals nearly at a
standstill as to funds and ideas. In the Middle
West especially, the editors of literary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[155-157]</span>
journals spend a good part of their time in
drumming up delinquent subscribers. The
principal activity manifested by many a college
literary magazine is to start and to stop.
They resemble the ephemeral Edinburgh university
magazine, described by Robert Louis
Stevenson: “It ran four months in undisturbed
obscurity and died without a gasp.”
To the modern era of literary productiveness
the college man, at least while in college,
seems to be a comparatively small contributor.
The best men are needed to make college journalism
popular, for deep within most students’
hearts is a love for real literature; as one student
said recently, “Many a man is found
reading classic literature on the sly.” It may
seem to an outsider that the student usually
prefers his heroes to be visible and practical,
jumping and fighting about on the athletic
field, much as certain persons prefer to hear a
big orchestra, the players in which can be seen
sawing and blowing and perspiring, rather
than to listen to mysterious, sweet, but unseen
music. Some day strong college leaders will
rise up to champion college journalism and
college reading as to-day they fight for athletics.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
Then college sentiment will make popular
the pen and the book.</p>

<p>When book-life is as popular as play-life,
college conversation will have new point; the
fraternity man will be able to spend an hour
away from the “fellows” and the rag-time
piano, and the docile professor, starting out
reluctantly to visit his students, will not need
to pray “Make me a child again just for to-night!”
as he immolates himself for a long,
dreary evening trying to smile and talk wisely
of college politics and base-ball averages.</p>


<h3>A NEW REALISM IN LITERATURE</h3>

<p>How is the undergraduate to be interested
in writing? How can college journalism be
made to take a real hold on the undergraduate’s
life? One might answer, present literature
and writing in an interesting manner,
bring out the humanity in it; for, above all,
the undergraduate is intensely human. New
college ideals and interests have been born,
and have grown up in a new age of literary
aspiration and method. The times demand
literature instinct with human interest, vital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
with reality. We may quarrel with the type;
we may call it vulgar and yellow and thin and
realistic, but the fact remains that it is the literary
temper of the day; and there are those
whose opinions are worthy of consideration
who believe that this new realism in literature
is by no means to be treated lightly, even in
comparison with the poetic and stately form
of Elizabethan letters.</p>


<h3>BOOKS AND THE UNDERGRADUATE</h3>

<p>The opportunity offered for cultivating acquaintance
with good books is not the least
reason for spending four years in a college atmosphere.
In the year 1700, when William
and Mary were on the throne of England,
James Pierpont selected eleven trustees, nine
of whom were graduates of Harvard, who, it
is recorded, met at Branford, Connecticut.
Each of the eleven brought a number of books,
and, laying them on the table, said, “I give
these books for the foundation of a college in
this colony.” This was the early foundation
of Yale. The influence of such foundations
upon the ideals of American students has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
considerable. Many a man has discovered in
college what Thackeray meant when he wrote
to his mother in 1852, “I used, you know, to
hanker after Parliament, police magistracies,
and so forth; but no occupation I can devise
is so profitable as that which I have at my
hand in that old inkstand.” Robert Louis
Stevenson&mdash;and who can forget him in thinking
of books?&mdash;said twenty years after his
school-days, “I have really enjoyed this book
as I&mdash;almost as I used to enjoy books when I
was going twenty to twenty-three; and these
are the years for reading. Books,” he continued,
“were the proper remedy: books of vivid
human import, forcing upon the minds of
young men the issues, pleasures, business, importance,
and immediacy of that life in which
they stand; books of smiling, or heroic temper,
to excite or to console; books of a large design,
shadowing the complexity of that game of consequences
to which we all sit down, the hanger-back
not least.”</p>


<h3>HOW TO INTEREST STUDENTS IN GOOD READING</h3>

<p>Some critics tell us that the undergraduate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
of to-day reads only his required books, and
talks nothing but athletics. One gets the impression
that the average college man feels
about his prescribed work in literature much
as D. G. Rossetti felt about his father’s heavy
volumes. “No good for reading.” The
fault is not wholly with the undergraduate.
There is need for a change of method in interesting
students in books. Too early specialization
has frustrated the student’s literary
tendencies. College men are forced into
“original research” before they know the
meaning of the word bibliography. They
rarely read enough of any one great author to
enter into real friendship with him. Classroom
study is often microscopic. Literature
is made easy for the student by the innumerable
sets of books giving dashes of the world’s
best literature, and chosen from an utterly
different point of view than the student would
take were he to make his own choice, thus often
prejudicing him against an author whom he
might otherwise have loved.</p>

<p>Grammatical and syntactical details too
often obstruct the path to the heart of classical
education. A student in one of our colleges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
had read the first six books of Vergil’s Æneid
in a preparatory school, and when his father
asked him what it was about, answered, “I
hadn’t thought about that.” The real charm
and interest of this classic had entirely escaped
him. It had been buried beneath a
mountain of philology. When we fail to
make the student realize that the best literature
of the world is interesting, why should
we wonder that the student’s literary realm is
invaded by the pseudo-psychological novel,
the humanly human though indelicate memoirs
which tend frequently to keep the mind
in the low and morbid levels?</p>

<p>Emphasis is needed on a few great books,
not upon everything. The student is often
discouraged by long lists of books, and it frequently
happens that he reads without assimilating.
A college friend of mine became an
example of devotion to Bacon’s injunction
about reading until one becomes a “full man.”
He was literally full to the brim and running
over with reading. He rarely laid down his
books long enough to prepare for his course
lectures; he certainly never stopped long
enough to think about what he had read. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
chief delight was in recounting the titles of
the books he had consumed in a given period.
He was something like Kipling’s traveler in
India, who spent his time gazing intently at
the names of the railway stations in his
Baedeker. When the train rushed through
the station he would draw a line through the
name, saying in a satisfied manner, “I’ve done
that.”</p>

<p>The undergraduate’s reading may be made
pleasurable instead of being a painful duty.
Books ought to open new rooms in his house
of thought, start new trains of ideas and action,
help him to find his own line, give just
views of the nation’s history and destinies, impart
a mental tone, and give a real taste for
literature, inspired by intellectual curiosity.
College reading should also awaken the soul
of the student and attach his faith to the loyalties
of life. A foot-ball coach said to me
recently that his team was defeated in the last
half of the game because of a lack of physical
reserve. His men were equal, if not superior,
to the other team in their technic, they followed
the signals, but they had not trained
long enough to secure the physical stamina<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
which is always an element of success in the
last half of the game. Good reading is good
training. Good books give mental and spiritual
reserve. They fill the reservoirs of the
mind and heart with the kind of knowledge
that arouses, sustains, and steadies a man in
a crisis. The best books assure power in the
right direction. A student whose mind is
filled with the best will have neither time nor
inclination for the literature that appeals only
to a liking for the commonplace and the sensational.
It will be unfortunate if Tennyson’s
indictment against an English university
become true of our American teachers:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Because you do profess to teach, and teach us nothing.</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Feeding not the heart.</div>
</div>
</div>


<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_165" style="max-width: 26.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_165.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">The Library and the Thomas Jefferson Statue, University of Virginia</p></div>
</div>


<p>To find not simply the laws of chemical
and electrical action, but also the laws of the
mind and the spirit, the nature of life and
death, and the character of “that power not
ourselves that makes for righteousness”&mdash;all
this should determine the lines of reading for
students outside of their specialty. Such
reading is not for acquisition, for attainment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[165-167]</span>
or for facts alone; it is for inspiration and
ideals, and a realizing sense of that passionate
joy derived from all things real and beautiful.</p>


<h3>THE PIONEER SPIRIT</h3>

<p>College training brings with it responsibility
and reward. The responsibility is that of
leadership&mdash;the kind of leadership which
comes to the man of advanced knowledge and
unusual advantages, who sees the needs of his
time and does not flinch from the hardest kind
of sacrifice in view of those needs. The reward
is not always apparent to the world, but
it is more than sufficient for the worker. Indeed,
the American undergraduate is becoming
more and more aware that his pay is not
his reward. He is learning that the world is
not keen to pay the cost of new ideas or to
reward professional leadership with material
values. Furthermore, his half-paid service
does not tell the whole story of his sacrifice.
His work is often lost in the successes of some
other man who follows him. But the college-trained
man who has weighed well these needs,
and has deliberately chosen, is not to be pitied.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Indeed, it is doubtful whether any one is more
to be envied. He is under the impulsion of an
inner sense of mission. The college has given
him faith in himself and his mission. Many
a graduate, going out from American halls
of learning, feels somewhat as Carlyle felt
when he said: “I have a book in me; it must
come out,” or as Disraeli intimated in his answer
when he was hissed down in the House of
Commons, “You will not hear me now, but
there will come a time when you will hear me.”</p>

<p>The undergraduate, spending laborious
days upon the invention which shall make industrial
progress possible in lands his eyes
will never see, is carried along by an impulse
not easily expressed. He realizes the feeling
that Robert Louis Stevenson expressed when
he said about his writing that he felt like
thanking God that he had a chance to earn his
bread upon such joyful terms. He has deliberately
turned his back upon certain temporalities
in order to face the sunrise of some new
ideal for social betterment or national progress.
He has heard the gods calling him to
some far-reaching profession that is more than
a position. There is stirring in him always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
the sense of message. He has caught the
clear, captivating voice of a unique life-work.
It urges him on to the occupation of his new
land of dreams. Is this leader worried because
some one misunderstands him? Does
he envy the man who, following another ideal,
sweeps by in an automobile which perhaps his
own particular genius has made possible?
The pioneer of letters who has known the
sweetness and light of literary satisfaction, the
fine frenzy of that creative, imaginative activity
in which ideas are caught and crystallized
in words, does not despair when his earthly
rewards seem to linger.</p>

<p>The college, then, is a means only to the
larger life of spirit and service. It exists to
point out the goal the attainment of which lies
inherent in the student. The college is like
the tug-boat that pulls the ship from the harbor
to the clear water of the free, open sea.
The curriculum, the play-life, the laboratory,
the patriotism of the college spirit, the buildings,
and the men, are only torches gleaming
through the morning shadows of the student’s
coming day.</p>

<h3>THE COLLEGE MAN AND THE WORLD</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">“How crooked can a modern business man
be and still be straight?”</p>

<p>This question was propounded at a college
dinner in New York by a young lawyer who,
in behalf of the recent graduates of an Eastern
university, had been asked to give utterance to
some of the first impressions of a young alumnus
upon his entrance into the life of the world.
The question was not asked in a trifling manner,
but it represented the query which inevitably
arises in the mind of the graduate of
ideals and high desires who to-day leaves his
alma mater to plunge into the confused business
and professional life of our times.</p>

<p>The question awakens the inquiry as to
whether the colleges of America are to-day
sending into the world trained leaders or subservient
followers; whether graduates enter
their special careers with a real message and
mission, or whether, however optimistically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
they may begin their work, their high purposes
are buried or not beneath the rush of practical
and material affairs.</p>

<p>More than half a million students are to-day
studying in our secondary schools and institutions
of higher learning, with a money expense
to the nation involving many millions dollars.
Tens of thousands of teachers and trained educators
are devoting years of hard and faithful
service in preparing these American youths
for life. Are these students, after graduation,
assuming real leadership? Are they contributing
vision, judgment, and guidance in
great national enterprises sufficiently definite
and valuable to compensate the country for
the sacrifices in time, money, and life that are
made for the support and continuance of our
educational institutions?</p>

<p>There seems to be a difference of opinion
concerning this subject even in these times of
vast educational enterprises. A business man
of high repute wrote to me recently as follows:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>I do not consider that our colleges are meeting the requirements
of modern business life. From your own
observation you must know that the most conspicuously
successful people in business were conspicuously poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
at the start, both financially and educationally. Grover
Cleveland, who was not a college graduate, once said
that the perpetuity of our institutions and the public
welfare depended upon the simple <i>business-like</i> arrangement
of the affairs of the Government.</p>
</div>


<p>This is the frequently expressed opinion of
men of business and affairs, who present the
successful careers of self-made men as an
argument against collegiate education. This
argument, however, fails to take into account
that the same dogged persistence which has
brought success to many of our present-day
leaders in industrial and national life would
have lost nothing in efficiency by college training.</p>

<p>Ask these masters of the business world who
have risen by their individual force what they
most regret in life. In nine cases out of ten
the answer will be, “The lack of an opportunity
for education.” And they will usually
add: “But my sons shall have an education.
<i>They</i> shall not be handicapped as I have
been.” For the practical proof of the genuineness
of this feeling, one has simply to read
over the names in the catalogues of the great
universities and colleges of America, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
the names of the sons of virtually all the great
business and professional men will be found.</p>

<p>While, therefore, we must take it for
granted that Americans generally believe
in a collegiate education, we may still question
whether the colleges are really equipping
for leadership the young men whom
they are sending into our modern life. What,
after all, do the colleges give? Out of one
hundred graduates whom I asked what they
had gained in college, twenty-one said,
“Broader views of life,” or perspective. Long
ago John Ruskin said that the greatest thing
any human being can do in the world is to see
something, and then go and tell what he has
seen in a plain way. To make the undergraduate
see something beyond the commonplace
is still the purpose of education. This enlarged
vision is often the salvation of the individual
student. It furnishes the impulse of a
new affection. It attaches him to some great,
uncongenial task. It gives him a mission
great enough and hard enough to keep his feet
beneath him. It saves him by steadying him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>


<h3>THE ART OF RELAXATION</h3>

<p>But no graduate is equipped for either
mental or moral leadership until he has learned
the art of relaxation. Both his health and his
efficiency wait upon his ability to rest, to relax,
to be composed in the midst of life’s affairs.
A real cause of American physical breakdown
has been attributed by a famous physician “to
those absurd feelings of hurry and having no
time, to that breathlessness and tension, that
anxiety of feature and that solicitude of
results, that lack of inner harmony and ease,
in short, by which with us the work is apt to
be accompanied, and from which a European
who would do the same work would, nine times
out of ten, be free. It is your relaxed and
easy worker, who is in no hurry, and quite
thoughtless most of the while of consequence,
who is your most efficient worker. Tension
and anxiety, present and future all mixed up
together in one mind at once, are the surest
drags upon steady progress and hindrances to
our success.”</p>

<p>We find that one of the supreme purposes
of education in ancient Greece was to prepare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
men to be capable of profiting by their hours
of freedom from labor. In his writing upon
education, Herbert Spencer gives special
attention to the training that fits citizens for
leisure hours.</p>


<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_179" style="max-width: 26.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_179.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Harper Memorial Building and the Law Building, University of Chicago</p></div>
</div>


<p>The American college graduate is quite certain
to receive early the impression that efficiency
is synonymous with hustling; that modern
life, in America at least, as G. Lowes Dickinson
has said, finds its chief end in “acceleration.”
His danger is frequently in his inability
to concentrate, to compose himself for real
thoughtful leadership. Many a graduate
takes years to get over that explosive energy
of the sophomore, which spends itself without
result. He takes display of energy for
real force. His veins are filled with the hot
blood of youth. He has not learned to wait.
He is inclined to put more energy and nervous
force into things than they demand. Like all
youth, he is inclined to scatter his energy in
all directions. He is therefore in danger
sooner or later of breaking down physically or
mentally, or both, and in spending the time
which should be utilized in serviceableness in
repairing the breakages of an uneconomic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[179-181]</span>
human machine. The average American
graduate rarely needs Emerson’s advice for a
lazy boy, which was, “Set a dog on him, send
him West, do something to him.”</p>

<p>College training must give a man permanent
idealism. Too often the graduate is
inclined to fall into the line of march. He
begins to worry and to lose his attractive
gaiety and buoyancy. His habits of thought
and study are soon buried beneath the myriad
details of business life or nervous pleasures.
He becomes anxious about things that never
happen. His anxiety about future happenings
or results takes his mind from present
efficiency. He becomes tense and tired and
irritable. The attitude of composure and
self-assurance which for a time he possessed in
college is changed to a fearsome, troubled state,
the end of which is the sanatorium or something
even more baneful. I have sometimes
thought that for a month at least I should like
to see the office signs, “Do it now,” “This is
my busy day,” “Step quickly,” replaced by
the old scriptural motto, “In quietness and
confidence shall be your strength.”</p>

<p>How shall our colleges assist American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
youth to secure the art of relaxation and to
obtain the ability to relieve the tension of the
workaday world by beneficial and delightful
relief from business strain? Such gifts will
often be the chief assets of a college man’s
training. Business men, and professional men,
too, frequently reach middle life with no interest
outside their specialties. When business
is over, life is a blank. There are no eager
voices of pleasant pursuits calling them away
from the common round and routine tasks.
It is too late to form habits. The rich
rewards that education may give in leisure
hours are lost, swallowed up by a thousand
things that are merely on the way to the
prizes that count. This is a terrific loss, and
for this loss our colleges are in part at least at
fault.</p>

<p>In certain institutions, however, we discover
teachers who realize that a real part of their
vocation consists in giving to at least a few
students habits of real and permanent relaxation.</p>

<p>In a New England college recently I found
a professor spending two afternoons a week in
cross-country walks with students to whom he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
was teaching at an impressionable age habits
that could be continued after college days.
These walks occurred on Sunday and Thursday
afternoons. With rigid persistence he
had followed the plan of walking with his students
for six or eight months, a sufficient time
in which to form habits. He explained his
object by saying that during his own college
career he had engaged in certain forms of athletics
which he was unable to pursue after
graduation. While his college physical training
had benefited him physically, he nevertheless
found himself quite without habits of bodily
relaxation. He was deprived of apparatus
and the opportunity for many out-of-door
games, but had found an immense value in
walking. In passing on to these college boys
this inclination for out-of-door relaxation, he
was perhaps contributing his chief influence as
a teacher.</p>

<p>Why should not habits of this kind be definitely
organized and carried out by the physical
departments of our colleges? The opportunity
to study trees, plants, and animals, and
to become watchful for a hundred varying
phases of nature, would furnish no small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
opportunity for projecting the influence of college
into later life.</p>

<p>These tendencies toward relaxation take
different forms according to individual tastes.
One graduate of my acquaintance finds outlet
for his nervous energy in a fish-hatchery. To
be sure, he bores his friends by talking fish at
every conceivable opportunity, and people frequently
get the impression that his mind has a
piscatorial rather than financial trend, as he
loses no opportunity to dilate upon his latest
adventure in trout; and yet his physician was
doubtless right in saying that this man, the
head of one of the largest financial institutions
in America, owes his life as well as his success
to this special form of relaxation.</p>

<p>A graduate of one of our large Western
technical schools who is at the head of a big
steel foundry has a private book-bindery,
where with two or three of his friends the life of
the world is lost evening after evening in
the quiet and delightful air of books and book-making.
The best treatises upon book-binding
line the walls. Old and rare editions of
the most famous masters are carefully sheltered
in cases of glass. One end of the room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
is filled with his printing and binding-machines.
He showed me a beautifully bound volume
which he himself had printed and bound.
As he lovingly fingered the soft leather, reading
to me his favorite passages from this masterpiece,
I discerned in him a different man
from the one I had often seen sitting in his
grimy office discussing contracts for steel rails
for China and bridge girders for South America.
A deeper, finer man had been discovered
in the hours of recreation. When asked how
he happened to become interested in a matter
so antipodal to his life-work, I found that the
tendency started in college days, when he had
been accustomed to browse among the books
in the old college library under the faithful
and regular guidance of a professor who once
every week took his students to the library
with the express purpose of inculcating a love
for old and beautifully bound books.</p>

<p>The college, moreover, should start the
graduate interest in philanthropic and serious
enterprises which in themselves furnish suitable
as well as pleasing relaxation to hundreds
of American university men. Letters received
from scores of recent graduates,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
many of whom are taking a large share in
moral, social, and philanthropic endeavors,
state that the beginnings of their interest
dated with their experience in the Christian
associations, settlement houses, boys’ clubs,
and charitable organizations of college days.
One man of large philanthropic interest received
his first view of a field of opportunity
and privilege by hearing a lecturer on a social
betterment tell of finding a homeless boy hovering
over the grating of a newspaper building
on a winter night. The story touched a
chord deep in the hearer, who saw this vision
of a world until then unknown to him&mdash;a
world of suffering and hunger and cold; and
when in later life it was made possible, he devoted
his influence and his fortune to the erection
of a home for friendless boys.</p>

<p>What is the college accomplishing toward
the solution of that vital subject, the question
of the immigrant? The possibilities of dealing
with such far-reaching international problems
is indicated by the influence of a college
debate upon the subject, “What shall we do
with the immigrant?” Through his reading
and investigation of the subject, a certain student<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
who engaged in this debate received his
first impetus toward what has proved to be
one of the main contributions of his life to the
nation by the establishment of Italian colonies
that are probably as effective as any plans
which are being suggested or utilized for the
betterment of our foreign population.</p>


<h3>MENTAL RESOURCEFULNESS</h3>

<p>According to President John G. Hibben of
Princeton, graduates on the average earn only
six dollars per week at the start. He justifies
this low earning power by saying, “It is our
endeavor to create a high potential of mental
possibility rather than actual attainment.”</p>

<p>We are inclined to consider efficiency only
as expressed along social, economic, industrial,
or mechanical lines. It is not strange in a
period when financial standing bulks large in
the minds of a comparatively new people
that the recognition of the learned classes
should be less noticeable than formerly. Yet
reactive tendencies from strictly utilitarian
education are evident. Individual and ideal
aims of education are beginning to emerge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
above the commercial and mechanical aims.
Already the salaries of college presidents and
college teachers are increased, offering additional
incentive for men of brains and scholarly
achievement. Masters of industry who
have been slaving for industrial and social
progress are now becoming eager to push their
accomplishments onward to mental and spiritual
satisfactions. How otherwise can we explain
such establishments as the Carnegie
Foundation, the millions of Mr. Morgan for
art, the vast sums contributed to religion and
education in this and other lands? The ethical
and social ideals of to-day are attaching
thousands of our best youth to far-reaching
endeavor. There is a new quest for that philosophy
of life which, as Novalis stated it,
could indeed bake no bread, but would give us
God, freedom, and immortality. These are
the signs of a new age of mental productivity&mdash;an
age in which scholarship and learning
will have a value for themselves; when people
will appreciate that it is not merely the book
one studies, but how he studies it that counts;
that if we can produce a man of scholarly,
thoughtful ability, we are sending into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
world a person who will be proficient along
any line in which he may engage.</p>

<p>In a Harvard address a few years ago, it
was remarked by Mr. Owen Wister that
America possessed only three men of unquestioned
preëminence to whom students could
turn for academic tuition in their respective
lines. I believe it was Edmund Gosse who
said that America had not produced a single
poet deserving to rank with the unquestioned
masters of English poetry. While these
statements may be questioned, one realizes the
general truth behind them when we contrast
the marvelous and expensive architectural
equipment of American universities with the
paucity of great men and teachers.</p>

<p>The trend of the times, however, is slowly
but certainly toward a new individualism.
Attention is being focused more and more
upon the values of life rather than upon the
volume of life. The college graduate may
not be able to deliver an oration in Hebrew
in the morning and in Latin in the afternoon,
but he is able to think through and around his
problem, and this is mental resourcefulness,
truly a chief aim of collegiate education and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
one of the first necessities for success. Emerson’s
prophecy may be realized in our day:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>Perhaps the time has already come, when the sluggard
intellect of this continent will look from under its
iron lids and fill the postponed expectation of the world
with something better than the exertion of mechanical
skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship
to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The
millions that around us are rushing into life cannot always
be fed on the sere remains of frozen harvests.
Who can doubt that poetry will revive and lead in a new
age, as the star in the constellation Harp, which now
flames in our zenith, astronomers announce shall one day
be the pole star for a thousand years.</p>
</div>


<p>The challenge is to our undergraduates.
And it will be accepted. The colleges will
teach men to think, to be mentally alert and
resourceful, and then the man will count in the
leadership of modern life, in the sense intended
by Dr. Simeon who, upon seeing a
trained graduate approach, exclaimed, “There
comes three hundred men.”</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this, however, the
college must make it a point to teach principles
rather than dogmatic methods. Too
often our systems of learning are too bookish.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
The boy is inclined to get the impression that
there is only one way to do a thing, and that
is the way he has learned from his professor
or his text-book. A business man told me
that he was recently obliged to dismiss one of
his college graduates because the young man
could not see or think of but one way to work
out a mechanical proposition. His training
had circumscribed him, cramped, limited, and
enslaved him instead of freeing him. He was
unable to move about easily in his sphere of
chosen activity. He had gained a prejudice
rather than a principle. He still lived in a
classroom, though out in the world. His progress
was water-logged in academic conservatism.</p>


<h3>LIFE-WORK PROPAGANDA</h3>

<p>It is, moreover, time for constructive action
on the part of both college and alumni in the
matter of directing students to their proper
calling. While it is impossible for our colleges
to make great men out of indifferent
raw material, it is possible to assist undergraduates
to discover their inherent bent or capacity.
Until the student has made such a discovery,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
the elective system which is now general
in our American institutions is something
of a farce. The lazy student, undecided in
his vocation, uses it as a barricade through
which he wriggles and twists to his degree, or
at best is tempted in a dozen various directions,
selecting disconnected subjects, in no
one of which he finds his chief aptitude. The
elective system to such a student is an art-gallery
without a key, a catalogue without the
pictures. He does not know what he wishes
to see.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">The Arch between the Dormitory Quadrangle and the Triangle, University of Pennsylvania</p></div>
</div>


<p>This undergraduate ability or inclination is
not easily grasped either by himself or by
others. It requires study and discriminating
sympathy, to extricate a main desire from
many incidental likings. Frequently the desire
itself must be virtually created. It is a
common remark among American undergraduates,
“I wish I <i>knew</i> what I was fitted for.”
The college is under deep obligation to serve
the nation not merely by presenting a great
number of excellent subjects, which, if properly
selected, will land the young man in
positions of leadership and usefulness; but it
may and must go beyond this negative education,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[193-195]</span>
and assist the student actually to form
his life purpose.</p>

<p>American institutions of learning are at
present neglecting an opportunity <i>par excellence</i>
for presenting different phases of life-work
to undergraduates, especially emphasizing
the relation of this life-work to the great
branches of leadership and modern enterprise.
There are hundreds of students
being graduated from our institutions to-day
who have not decided what they
are to do in after life. Even if we assume
that these men are prepared in an all-round
way for life, it must be realized that they are
severely handicapped by the necessity of trying
different lines of work for years after
graduation before fixing upon their permanent
vocation. They not only miss the tremendous
advantage of enthusiasm and impulse
of the young, but they are also in danger
of drifting rather than of moving forward
with positive and aggressive activity.</p>


<h3>A NEW COLLEGE OFFICER NEEDED</h3>

<p>I see no possibility of bringing undergraduates
to a decision of their proper life-work without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
the assistance of a new office in our educational
institutions. A man is needed who can
treat with students with real human interest,
as well as with teaching intelligence. He
should not be the college pastor, who is looked
upon as a professional religionist, and therefore
shunned by many students who need him
most, but one definitely and actively responsible
for the development of leadership. He
should be a close student of college affairs,
sympathetic with students, human, high-minded,
natural, and keenly alive to humor
and social interests. In some institutions this
man might hold the leadership in philanthropic,
religious, and social-service interests. It
might be his privilege to arrange lectures by
leading men of the country who were filled
with zeal for their callings. The man who
could make possible the endowment of such a
chair in a great university would be doing a
great work for his country.</p>


<h3>LEARNING AND INVESTIGATION</h3>

<p>But while the American undergraduate may
consistently look to the college to furnish him
with ideals and with the methods of making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
these ideals effective, the world looks to the
college for definite and advanced information.
The college, with its accumulated stores of intellect,
its apparatus, and its unusual means
for observation, owes the world a debt that
none but it can pay. And this is the gift
which the college has given, and is still giving,
to the world so quietly, so unobtrusively, that
the world scarcely dreams of the source of its
gain. Let one think of the myriad signs of
modern progress by which society is being constantly
carried forward. Behind the scenes
you will find some quiet, hidden worker in a
laboratory or library, an unpractical man perhaps,
but one through whom a new realm of
possibilities in science or industry or letters
have been revealed.</p>

<p>What is the world’s interest in these men&mdash;men
who are so generally underpaid that
much of their best work is made impossible by
the necessary outside labors to support their
families, who, beyond their own personal satisfaction,
have as little recognition as perhaps
any workers of modern society? When the
world demands expert knowledge in industry,
science, literature, and art, the college may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
well reply, “When are you going to show your
gratitude for the self-sacrifice and far-reaching
labors of thousands of devoted men whose
work is both a challenge and an example to the
world to-day?”</p>

<p>And this example of the man who learns to
devote himself to one thing is not lost upon the
undergraduate, to whom example is ever
stronger than precept. Indeed, it is this tendency
to learn how to do one thing well that is
bringing the colleges into the attention of the
modern world. The secret of genius is to be
able to seize upon some concrete, near-at-hand
piece of work, to see it with unobstructed
and steady vision, and then, out of the rich
treasure of knowing how to do one thing thoroughly,
to draw by insight and expression the
general principle.</p>

<p>For, after all, the contribution of the college
to the world is often one which cannot be
fully analyzed. It is not discovered in a thorough
knowledge of a curriculum or in the
statistics of athletics any more than a foreign
country is discovered in a guide-book or in a
hasty recital of its industries. There is no
master word to express what a college career<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
may mean or should mean to American youth
who in years of high impression experience
with a multitude of their fellows.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Days that flew swiftly like the band</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">That in the Grecian games had strife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And passed from eager hand to hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The onward-dancing torch of life.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>After we have said much concerning the life
and the work of the American undergraduate,
there is still a valuable thing which the college
should impart to him, and through which he
should become enabled to present with greater
charm and with greater force the message
which is in his soul. This valuable thing, at
once both idealism and incentive, is the undergraduate’s
<i>individual</i> message to the world.
It may be composed of knowledge, the ability
to think, the faculty of relaxation, and the
power to do faithfully and successfully some
given task. These things, however, are all
dependent upon the <i>spirit</i> of the actor, upon
his vision, his determination, his ambitious and
unflagging attempts. The true modern
university contributes to the world a great-minded
and a great-hearted man, to whom college<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
life has been a soul’s birth as well as a
mind’s awakening. It gives to its youth that
peculiar but indispensable thing which burned
in the heart of the young art-student who
stood before the masterpiece and said, “I, too,
am a painter.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
